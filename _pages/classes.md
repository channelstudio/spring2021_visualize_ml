# Classes

## Class 1 - 1/20

Introductory class. We began by having everyone answer the following questions:

* What program are you in?
* Why are you taking this class?
* What is your background and experience?
* What are you interested in?

This class is about using machine learning to explore archives.

The data problem - we have more information now than ever before, and it is growing exponentially.

Cultural institutions are digitizing and open sourcing massive collections. Beyond this, what is a dataset? Perhaps shopping inventories are datasets? Movies are a dataset. Google photos is a dataset. 

There are growing datasets that we want to be able to search on a semantic basis.

At the same time, people expect better and better digital experiences. Companies like Google, Uber, etc are spending tons on design to create the best experiences they can. They are setting the bar for online experiences.

Design is about sorting/organizing/making information digestible. We are designing the experience of exploring a dataset using machine learning as a design tool.

A main concept for the class is using machine learning and AI to augment or facilitate, not to create.

We looked at the following references (the first six do not use ML):

What is scripting?

* A scripting or script language is a programming language for a special run-time environment that automates the execution of tasks; the tasks could alternatively be executed one-by-one by a human operator. Scripting languages are often interpreted. - Wikipedia

Python is a scripting language that we will be using in this class. It is highly versatile, high-level, general-purpose programming language that is quickly becoming one of the most popular languages.

We covered the terminal in advance of Python (next class)

[Quick guide here](https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-to-the-mac-os-x-command-line)

Import commands to be familiar with:
* pwd
* ls
* cd
* mkdir
* rmdir
* rm
* mv
* cp
* open .
* cat

Using the terminal, we installed [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

First, make sure you have Xcode command-line tools installed. Note - this is *not* the Xcode editor. These are separate tools that run from your command line. Run the commands below (without the `$` at the beginning of the line):

```console
$ xcode-select --install
```

Next, we install Homebrew by running the following command:

```console
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Run the following command once you’re done to ensure Homebrew is installed and working properly:

```console
$ brew doctor
```

Next, we install Python 

```console
$ brew install python
```

Check your install with the following command

```console
$ python --version
```

It should say report a version of python 3 or higher
