## Week 4 (due 2/17)

* Read
  * [Using Artificial Intelligence to Augment Human Intelligence](https://distill.pub/2017/aia/) - you should have read by now, but we will discuss in class again
  * [Creative AI](https://medium.com/@creativeai/creativeai-9d4b2346faf3) - optional reading, will discuss in class

* Code
  * Review the notes from class and be sure you understand the concept of the perceptron
  * Watch videos/read articles if unclear
  * Try implementing the perceptron on another dataset

## Week 3 (due 2/10)

* Read
  * [Anatomy of an AI System](https://anatomyof.ai/)
  * [Don’t Call AI “Magic” by M.C. Elish](https://points.datasociety.net/dont-call-ai-magic-142da16db408)

* Watch (optional)

  * [Vectors - The Nature of Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWJkvxQXIa8)
  * [Vector Math - The Nature of Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6b1_3bNCxk)
  * [Vector Math II - The Nature of Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHusbFmq-4I)

* Code
  * Review the in class jupyter notebook
  * Try implementing your own classifier using one of the other [Scikit learn toy datasets](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html#toy-datasets). Google around for ideas. This will not be graded or collected.


## Week 2 (due 2/3)
* Read

* Code
  * Review the in class jupyter notebook
  * If you are having a hard time with Python, try doing all the "Learn the Basics" section at [learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/)
  * I recommend also picking up Learn Python 3 the Hard Way if you like learning from printed books


## Week 1 (due 1/27)
* Read
  * [Using Artificial Intelligence to Augment Human Intelligence](https://distill.pub/2017/aia/)
