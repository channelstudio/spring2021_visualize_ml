      "So I'm gunna post my review of the game here... it's big and stuff so I apologize but I didn't wanna start a new thread again.Pokemon X/YWhere to begin... Well I guess at the start. I have been playing Pokemon games since they started. My first game was Pokemon Blue and I have never missed one in the series since. The joy of finding new Pokemon never seems to get old for me. SO when I learned about Pokemon X/Y I was of course Joyful as I usually was when hearing about a new Pokemon game.Nothing could prepare me for this game. Nothing.Gameplay 10/10For those new to Pokemon, You enter a world where we capture, raise, and battle with Animals known as Pokemon. They gain levels, have stats, learn different attacks and each has their own elemental Strengths and Weaknesses attached to them. Fire is weak to water, Water is weak to Grass, Grass is weak to fire etc... there are 18 I believe elements in total and all have their own Rock-Paper-Scissors Pros and Cons. This is back and of course just as fun as ever. Do you want to make a team of all bug Pokemon? Go for it! but know that you will be weak against Flying, Rock and Fire types, and yet strong against Psychic, Poison and Grass etc... Or you could have a team of various Pokemon, ready to fight against all types whenever the need arises. Building your own team has always been a highlight of the series, and with over 700... let me stop right there. SEVEN HUNDRED... different Pokemon to chose from you have a ridiculous number of monsters to chose from to form your 6 slot party. Now not all 700+ are in the game, I believe only around 4-5 hundred are to start, but you can trade Pokemon from previous games up and use them if your friends have it or you can even go back and try the old games etc... But this game has plenty of Pokemon to try out and have fun withFor those that are familiar with Pokemon , this game has everything you would ever want and much MUCH more. First off they have streamlined how leveling your Pokemon works. No longer do you have to Slowly one by one level each of your Pokemon against weak wild Pokemon and then grind more and more and more etc... Instead the game has made a few key changes to how EXP works which I shall list below.1. Any Pokemon that participates in the battle now gets 100% EXP, it no longer gives 50% to one and 50% to another. or 33% to all three etc...2. You get an EXP.Share about 1 hour into the game (After the first gym battle) And this time it is not even a held item! It sits in your inventory and as you fight, any Pokemon that participated in battle gets 100% Exp, any in your party that didn't get 50% exp. This is beyond amazing and is a fantastic way to level your low level Pokemon quickly without having to suffer from putting it in front, and switching out your Pokemon every single fight. If you don't like this feature, you can of course turn it off in the item menu. I suggest not doing so3. Catching a Pokemon still grants you EXP as if you had killed it.As a result of these new EXP changes you spend almost no time simply leveling up Pokemon and instead you will be spending your time trying to catch the Pokemon then you will simply grinding. In fact There are a few Pokemon in each area that aren't quite as common as others. For example in Route 1 there is a Zigzagoon that is harder to find than the more common Pidgey's Fletchings, and Caterpie that wander around. There always seems to be one in each area, and in an attempt to find it you naturally level up your Pokemon (Unless you are running from every battle).Now battles themselves have remained, from a mechanics standpoint, nearly untouched and that's a good thing. There has never been anything wrong with combat in Pokemon and this never needed to be changed. They did of course change the graphics and animations which I will touch on later. There are a lot of smaller, what I like to call Quality of Life Improvements, to the UI and everything that I don't see the need to go into here as if you see them you will know exactly what I mean.EV Training (Effort Values) has become much simpler this time around, you don't have to guess and check what your Pokemon's EV points are. To make along story short, EV points are how the game determines what stat bonuses a Pokemon gains. In all previous games EV points were given only by defeating Pokemon , each Pokemon gives different values. In this game, you can still do that, but you can also use training mini-games on the touch screen to raise it manually. These can get repetitive but it is a fantastic way to make sure your Pokemon get's the points in the stats you want them to be in. I spent an hour filling out my ZigZagoons speed and Attack stats so I knew it would gain the most in those 2 areas as he leveled. If you mess up or don't like how it turned out, you can actually reset EVs now using a specific item. It's been simplified for the best In my opinion as now everyone can take advantage of the EV system and in a much nicer visual way.I wanted to throw this little addition in there, for the first time in pokemon history you more or less get free movement. No longer are you permanently tied to a Grid format. Once you get the Roller Blades (About 1 hour into the game) you are able to move in full 3D movement with the joystick, you can still move in a grid format on the D-pad for precise movement. You are still limited to the grid inside of Pokemon Centers and houses, but so far that's all it's been limited too. I love this, it's a simple change but lord do I love it. Just another Quality of Life mechanic they put in.The Pokemon Aime system looked odd to me at first. It was more or less Nintendogs with Pokemon (sort of). And I kind of ignored it to begin with, But I did give it a try a little bit later and while yes it is still just a way to view and... well pet and feed your Pokemon it's also got hidden bonuses. The first is obvious, the more you pet and play with them the quicker their happiness grows. There are some Pokemon Like Riolu that will only evolve if they are happy enough. The secondary effect is it also grants another form of EXP boost. As you play and feed them their heart meter grows, granting a bonus to EXP gained as you battle, similar to if you had traded them from another trainer. I didn't learn about this until later but now that I know about it, I take time out of my farming to play with my Pokemon a bit, at least the ones I like!The last and certainly not least, new addition is the Mega Evolutions. It's a simple concept really, take an old favorite Pokemon like Mewtwo, Charizard, Blastoise etc... give them a special stone, and press a button on your magical we promise this has nothing what so ever to do with Digimon bracelets, and poof. You get a new Mega Evolution Pokemon! More or less a 4th form for some. Now these are super powerful Pokemon that can really dish out some damage, but only lasts for the one battle, and on top of that you can only have one in your party (or something like that) I am not actually far enough in the game to be able to comment much more on this, but I had to mention that it's there and I am kinda excited to try it out later.All in all, the gameplay is top notch and Fantastic.Music/Sounds 9/10I have always liked Pokemon music, this just seemed to take it to a new level. The only issue I have is that the 3DS/3DSXL's speakers don't give it justice, I hooked the system up to a speaker system in my apartment and then the music came to life, in fact more than I expected. Eery song was fantastic and fit the scene well the battle music is quick and gives an odd sense of urgency, the forest music was somewhat dark and mysterious and the town songs are nice and upbeat. My favorite song thus far is the Gym battle music which... I can't even describe but it's awesome!The sound effects are also as good as ever. Each Pokemon has their own unique Cry (Noise they make) and all Pokemon from previous games have had theirs enhanced to match the quality of the new ones. I noticed this first with Linoone as he is my favorite Pokemon so I noticed his Cry had changed since I've used him in every Pokemon game since he was introduced in Sapphire/Ruby. The battle sound effects also fit the attacks and meld perfectly in with the attack. I can hear that rock throw hitting my Linoone, and it sounds... heavy.My only minor complaint is that they didn't use the Pokemon's voices like the TV show does. The only Pokemon in the game that does is Pikachu, and I really think that they could have just made it that much better had they had all of them sound like they do in the show. It's a minor complaint but there it is!The New PokemonI didn't give this a rating because it's pure opinion, but I haven't found anything wrong with the new Pokemon. They keep coming up with some pretty awesome Ideas of new Pokemon to add... and yes some not so awesome ideas. (I don't' think I will ever forgive them for the Garbage Bag Pokemon from Black/White). I've encountered a Pokemon based on the Robin, A Panda, I've ever seen a Sword Pokemon (Ghost type). Heck my favorite Pokemon is based on a badger. All have their own personalities and it shows during combat and in the Pokemon-Aime thing. It's all a matter of what you like and what you don't like.Graphics 10/10Ok, the biggest update the game has received is to it's graphics. Up to this point, Pokemon games have been nothing but Sprites and sometimes a little movement. All your characters, sprites. All the Pokemon, slightly moving in combat sprites. They didn't have a life of their own, it felt somewhat empty... but no longer.This game, looks, FANTASTIC. One of the best looking games on the 3DS, and it doesn't suffer from poor framerate. I didn't quite realize how much effort they put into the Pokemon's Models until I started battling with them. Every Pokemon past and present has been redone with a 3D model, and I couldn't be happier. Anyone who has played any of the Pokemon stadium games will be familiar with how they look, but now we have them in the Pokemon game! Each Pokemon has their own movements and animations which is even more amazing to me. Take ZigZagoon and Linoone for example. ZigZagoon is known for moving in a ZigZag pattern, so when it attacks it does just that, running left, then right, then left, then attacking. Due to irony, when it evolves it no longer runs in zigzag patterns, it runs in a straight line but is unable to turn easily, so it's attack is no longer a zigzag, it's a straight dash at the opponent, then a jump backwards. This is just one of many examples of each Pokemon's different movements. Attacks also have their own looks and animations, some look better than others but that is to be expected. Now will they look as good as they do when fighting in the show? No, they still for the most part stay in their own battle &#34;Circles&#34; but they just look so much better when fighting I love it, I can't complain at all about it. I really can't praise the game's graphics enough... they took their time with it.Outside of battle, the game still looks amazing, the grass and tall grass still look like they used to and in a tile format, but your character and the other characters all have nice 3D models, even if you don't see them all in combat. You can change your characters clothes, get a little customization there but sadly it's limited to just a few different outfits. I suppose it's better than nothing though!Multiplayer 10/10Lets talk Multi-player. A lot of us as kids got this game and loved to trade and battle with each other, trying to have the better team, etc... But it has always been restricted in many ways. until the DS games came out, internet battling never happened. And even on the DS versions it was still limited and somewhat sluggish. Black/White added the GTS (Global Trade System) why became a great way to obtain hard to find Pokemon, or Pokemon from previous entries in the series you just didn't have the ability to get. But it was still a tad bothersome as you had to go to a specific location, or go to the Pokemon centers to activate these features.NOT ANYMORE!Pokemon X/Y said screw all that moving around, you can battle, Trade, etc... On the go! you wanna trade with a friend? Tap on his avatar on the bottom screen and say &#34;hey I wanna trade&#34; same with battling. If they accept POOF. You trade/battle right then and there. You can even do this for random passer-bys. On the bottom screen will be a constantly updating list of other random players you can challenge to battles or trade with.That not enough for ya? The GTS Is also here, and available world wide. Search for a Pokemon you want to trade for, and it will bring up a list of players that have put that Pokemon up for trade, and what they want in return. You can deposit one of your own, and ask for another Pokemon. For instance say I want a Zangoose, I can deposit a Seviper into the GTS and say &#34;I will trade this for a Zangoose&#34; if someone accepts it the trade occurs and you can pick up the Pokemon later. That's the best part about this, you don't have to sit and wait. It's all done even if your game is turned off. You merely have to check up on it later! you also don't have to Have the Pokemon on you to trade, trading anywhere allows you to access your Storage Bank of Pokemon and trade from there, this is a new feature and one i welcome with wide open arms.This time around they added 2 new features to the Multiplayer!The first is Wonder Trade. This is an... interesting New one. You trade one of your Pokemon , any one ya want, to another random person. You don't know what you are going to get until the trade is completed. And you can do this infinitely. You will probably get a lot of junk Pokemon , but I have already received some things I didn't expect. I got an Eevee, and a wierd other Pokemon I had never seen before. Along with like 3 Caterpies. But still, it's random fun. And each time you use an interaction like Wonder Trade, Trade, Battle... you gain PokeMiles which can be traded for useful items at a vendor in the main city.The other thing they added is O-powers. these are short term buffs you can give yourself or other players. Things like &#34;raise Attack, Raise Defense, Increase Capture Rate, etc...&#34; They last about 3 minutes (at least at level 1) and can be sued as long as you have.. O points I guess they are called. you recover the Points as time passes, using the ability in yourself costs the full point value and using it on a friend or other player costs 1/2 the value. It's just a fun way to help others or yourself out.Final Score:I give Pokemon X/Y, 9 Linoones and a Zigzagoon (9.5) out of 10.It's not perfect, but damn it's close. This is the Pokemon game that I have always wanted ever since the original Pokemon Stadium came out, showing off the Pokemon in 3D. I am a little sad that there isn't a version on the Console, I'm sure they will still make the Stadium U game, but Those only deal with combat, this is the whole game and I adore it. My only complaints I have are really the same complaints I have had from the start of Pokemon's Existence. I hate HMs. Always have, always will.If you are New to the Pokemon series, this is probably the best to start on, even if the start is a bit rough for new players. (They don't explain a heck of a lot it just assumes you know some things by now). But it's also the best in the entire series for experienced and casual returning players alike.\n",

      "Pokemon Silver is the newest addition to the Pokemon series. It has the same gameplay as the original and has over 100 more pokemon. This game would have gotten a higher rating if it was the only Pokemon game to come out. Unfortunately, it's similar to the other Pokemon games making it repititous. If you aren't a crazed pokemon fan then don't get it. If you are then I highly reccomend it, as it will give justice to the Pokemon phenomenon.\n",

      "Pokemon Platinum has a few parts in it that are different then Pearl and Diamond, but over all it is pretty much similar. If you are a Pokemon fan and you collect the games, I would not miss out on buying it though. A good example to use is the classic game, Pokemon Gold and Silver Version. Nintendo later made Pokemon Crystal Version. It had a few parts in the game that were different then Gold or Silver, it had a different Legendary Pokemon that the game was centered around, but over all, the game was similar. In my opinion, Pokemon Platinum was a step up than Pokemon Crystal. It actually has much more after the game that Pearl and Diamond didn't have. A few more Legendary Pokemon are now available in Platinum that were not in Pearl and Diamond too. So, if your a Pokemon game collector, or just a fan of Pokemon, I wouldn't miss out on Pokemon Platinum. It's like playing Pearl and Diamond all over again only twice more better and funner. Pokemon Platinum Version is a must have...\n",

      "A note: This review does NOT apply to Pokemon Emerald, Ruby and Sapphire's counterpart, since I have not played Pokemon Emerald.Ahh, Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire. By far some of the best games in Pokemon history so far. (Pokemon Firered in close second.)Longtime Pokemon fans with obviously enjoy this great game,(Like myself) and it will surely introduce many new fans to the series.You start out as either a male or female trainer. After a bit of talking, you discover that the town's local professor, Professor Birch, (Yes, as in a Birch tree) being cornered by a grumpy Poochyena. You grab one of the Pokemon from his bag, (A Treeko, grass type, Torchic, Fire type, or Mudkip, water type) And use it to defend the professor. That Pokemon will become your first ever Pokemon. And so, the adventure begins! (Geez, what a cliche'd line, lol.)Anyway, this game has many, many, (Insert the word 'many' a whole bunch of times ^-^) new features.First of all, a huge bundle of brand new Pokemon! And now, thanks to Pokemon Firered and leafgreen, you can get the 151 of the Kanto region in here too! Sadly, there are no new Pokemon Gold/Silver remakes...yet.Plus, there are Contests! Contests are special...well...contests, based on several categories, like Beauty, Tough, and Cute. Raise your pokemon to fit Contest form with Pokeblocks, a special candy that increases it's Coolness, Cuteness, Toughness, etc. Pokemon moves are also categorized. Such as, Bubble is a Cute move, and Brick Break is a Tough move, therefore, they can be used in their respective contests.There are also Natures, which can affect the way a Pokemon grows. Examples of Natures are: Relaxed, or Brave. Also, they affect the types of Pokeblocks a Pokemon likes.Abilities are another new feature. They are basically, special Pokemon abilities. Such as, the ability, Keen Eye. A Pokemon with the Keen Eye ability stops accuracy reduction in battle. Very, very useful!!Plus, a herd of new Pokemon moves! And, a bundle of new Pokeballs!The main Legendary Pokemon are Groudon, Kyogre, and Rayquaza. You can get Rayquaza in both games, but Groudon is only in Ruby, and Kyogre is only in Sapphire. But, if you own Pokemon Emerald, you can get all three!There are also even more Legendaries! Latios, Latias, Regirock, Registeel, Regice, Jirachi, and Deoxys.Well, that's pretty muhc all I'll tell you. I don't want to ruin any surprises. But, here are a few helpful tricks and tips:* As I have said in a Pokemon Firered reviews, DON'T Use all uber Legendaries. For one, no one will battle you, in fear of getting creamed, and second, it's not original. Nowadays, EVERYONE uses all Legendary teams in Official Competitons, and there's no variety, and no challenge to win. -_-; Not so 'Legendary' any more, huh?*CATCH SHINY POKEMON. Do I need to underline it? They are Pokemon colored differently than usual, and SUPER rare. I have not encountered one yet on my Ruby and Sapphire versions, but I have a Shiny Graveler on Firered. They are recognizable by a shimmery glow of stars around them, and their different colors. If you see one, CATCH IT!*Plant Berries! Currently, on Sapphire, I used up all the game's berries, and I can't plant many more. (I think I have the dreaded Berry Glitch) Berries are useful in battle, and are used to make Pokeblocks for Pokemon Contests.*This isn't really a tip...more of an evaluation. If you are a Newbie to Pokemon games, don't choose Torchic. It is weak to many Gym leaders, but is great for expierienced trainers. (I have a Blaziken, evolves form of Torchic, and let me tell you, it was touhg deafeatinbg Roxanne, a Rock type gym leader.) Treecko would be a better chocie, since it is strong against more Gym Leaders than the other two. Mudkip will be good for intermediate players.Well, that's all!\n",

      "What I mean by the title is this; the first time you play it, you won't be thinking \"game\" at all.Instead, you'll be pulled in by the surreal graphics, compelling storyline, and realistic characters.I can honestly say that this is my favorite game, due to the fact that it actually became part of my life, instead of me beating it and getting ready for the next game.I never knew what \"psychological damage\" was, exactly, until I played this.Though it didn't damage me in the ways of: I need to suicide or go do drugs, but more in the way of slight depression; nothing so serious that you'd need a shrink or anything, but more of a sadness.After you beat it the first time, you'll have most likely gone down the path you've chosen and have liked the way it turned out. If that's the case, the 2nd+ time you play it and go down a different path, you'll have to do certain things that you normally wouldn't. This is kind of what messes it up, because the first time you play it, you want your actions and responses to be right, or just how you want them to be. Then when you play again, you'll start feeling uncomfortable since you don't REALLY want to do the things you're doing, but just have to do it to see the other endings.After I played it the first time, then started on the 2nd/3rd play through, it started becoming more of a game, and was \"easily-put-downable\" when I started getting frustrated/bored. (Not really frustrated or bored, but the first time you play it you don't want to stop playing because you HAVE to see what happens next, but after you play it once, it loses the gripping factor.)People will say that the shocking twist near the end of the game ruins it; I say otherwise.Though I can agree that it \"may\" ruin it, I still like the way the characters react and deal with the situation.So for me, the game never goes into an \" aw, that ruined my whole experience! \" moment, ever.There are 57 trophies in the game, in which you are awarded by doing specific and particular things within each chapter.I updated this game the moment I got it, which was a tedious 1.1gb download, and with my slow internet I had to wait a whole day until it finished.I never played it before I patched it, but I figured if I'm going to play it, I might as well download the patch; seeing as it fixed camera issues, new main menu and supposedly bonus content (making-of videos).I got the version of Heavy Rain without the blue PS Move compatible logo, so I don't know if that version has the update pre-installed or not, seeing as it's the Move Compatible version.But the patch installed on the previous version installs the Move patch as well, so everyone can enjoy Move no matter what version they have.It's very hard to express why this game is great without telling spoilers; but if you're like me, I didn't want to see a single video of Heavy Rain before I got it, because I knew it would ruin everything - and I can say, if I had watched a video of Heavy Rain prior to gameplay, I would have been upset seeing as playing this game without knowledge of anything is the best way to go.I don't even know if I've started the review yet, but let me start explaining the aspects of the game.The game is single player, has trophies, and has 1 Downloadable Content episode (the game creator has basically said that after they finished working on PS Move version of Heavy Rain, and they started working on new DLC they figured it would waste time, and said that they would rather work on a new project, instead of spending more time on Heavy Rain.)Which I find stupid, how can you \"waste time\" on something that can still be played?But, I am fine with this, especially after playing the first and most-likely only DLC.(*1*) - GRAPHICS: 9.0The graphics in this game are spectacular, the skin textures and overall ambiance are better than any game I've ever seen.I watched video reviews, (after the fact), and I saw that they were all complaining about a few things, one in particular is how this game is supposed to be a cinematic presentation-styled game, yet some scenes of the game's textures are terrible.This is true, even though I don't feel that way about it.I admit, some scenes will have the character's face slimy-looking and textureless, and while these scenes and moments in the game come a little bit too often, it doesn't ruin gameplay aspects, but it will be noticeable and might have an awkward \" uhh \" effect on you and anyone watching you play it.Other than that, graphics are great, one of the few games (if not only) that actually makes rain in a game look good.----------------------------------------------------------(*2*) - STORYLINE: 10I might be a bit off with giving it a 10, but I'll explain.As I've said above, the first time you play it, you just know that the game is just what you're looking for (if you're looking for one of the few great Mystery/Crime games.)Some people will say the game is very slow and boring in the beginning, but quickly ramps up after an hour or so; but I say different. I'm actually pleased that the game developers gave the audience time to introduce the characters, instead of just starting the game in mid-battle or like you already know them and are well-acquainted;The story introduces each character and shows you what their issues are, or what they have to deal with daily, and gives you a starting point on how you want to play with your characters.What I didn't know in the beginning, though now I do, is why all your actions, in the beginning and middle of the game, don't actually change anything towards the story or the ending.But now I see that it's because the game is trying to shape your opinion of your character.It's basically testing you in the beginning/middle of the game, to see what you want your characters to do when it all starts coming down.I do agree, though, that the game gets a lot better after your choices REALLY start to mean something.You honestly start to feel sad and scared when your characters are in near-death experiences.This is the FIRST game EVER, that I was actually scared for my CHARACTERS life in any game.It wasn't like \"Oh no, I'm gonna die\", it was more like \"OH NO, NORMAN'S GONNA DIE!!!!!11!!!1!111!\"It tells you something if you're playing a game, and are actually scared for your characters, instead of only scared that you, yourself, are about to lose a battle.People also say that the characters are good and all, but aren't enough for you to connect with them and get a chance to feel for them. I could say that it's true and untrue. Reason is, you don't ever feel like you're INSIDE your character, but more like you're just looking at them from the outside. However, who can say that being inside them is so great?From what I've seen, looking at them from the outside is still an emotional ride. I felt for each character like it was someone I knew going through these things (all thanks to the introductory part of the game.)This would have to be my favorite storyline of any game, because it's one game that actually left it's mark in my memory; a solid mark.---------------------------------------------------------(*3*) GAMEPLAY - 9.0It's hard to say when it comes to this game's gameplay. I don't know how to explain it.I've read that people say that this game is just one big quick time event, and that they will hate Q.T.E.'s in any game they play from now on. My ending results didn't tally up to that one.There ARE a lot of Q.T.E.'s, but it isn't so much to the point of you wanting to destroy all Q.T.E.'s.I never had a problem with it, or even moments where I thought to myself: \"When will this be OVER!!?!?!?\"When it comes to movement in games, you'd think move the analog left or right to go left or right, but this game is a little bit different. Yeah, you move by holding R2, then moving the left Analog stick in which way you want to go, but it's a bit hard at times. Specifically moments where the camera automatically switches when you walk pass a certain point, then you try to turn left or something, then you'll start going backwards and the camera flicks back to the way it was before you CAME to that point. All in all, it's annoying, but only when you get to those moments in the game.But with that aside, movement in this game is realistic, and never at a time does it make you tired of walking.My game has only gotten stuck 2 times, even though I've had it just a week, but to my knowledge and what I've seen, the game doesn't get stuck every chapter, maybe like just once the whole game.-------------------------------------------(*4*) SOUND - 9.5Personally I love the soundtrack, it complements the weary ambiance and sad game tone, and adds to what you feel for your character. People say that the characters' voices in the game are at-times: terrible. I could agree, but then I think of the reason why people are saying they're terrible. Everyone's voice in the game is pretty much top-notch, except the character Norman Jayden.His voice can sound tremendously weird at times, and will make you a little bit scared for no reason at all.The voice actor would turn some words into the weirdest thing yet. Example; a sentence he said in the game was similar to this: \"All the victims were drowned in rain water.\"  Ok, sound right? Well this is how he pronounced it:\"All the victims wuh drowned in rain wahtuh.\"  It's kinda creepy; it does it on similar occasions in parts of the game.But then, I realized something. This game was made in Europe (Quantic Dream is a European based company) IE: SCEE (Sony Computer Entertainment Europe.) And I guess to people, the way he pronounces things would make them think \"Why is this an American game, and is supposed to be American characters, yet the voices sound like they aren't?\" And for some reason, they think of it as a negative, and that it's bad voice acting.But this game ISN'T American. And though the game's story is based on the east coast of USA, (most likely somewhere along the lines of New York), who says the characters in the game ARE American? Especially with Norman Jayden being an FBI agent, not normally stationed in this east coast city.So I just disagree with statements such as it's an American game, with non-American voice actors.But I will say that at times, at least every character has 1 moment in the game where they sound weird.---------------------------------------------(*5*) MISCELLANEOUSBefore I got this game, I was quite worried about the nudity in the game.Reading on websites, it kind of made it seem like a full-on, non-stop, \"IN YO FACE\" kind of thing.This is NOT the case. There are just 3 times in the game in which you encounter these scenes.Only 1 time will you be unable to bypass it. (2 times if you want a platinum trophy)The first scene you'll be forced to watch, it's Ethan in the shower.It doesn't show anything in the front, just his butt. It may seem like it's going to show more than that with the way the camera moves, but that's it. It gets a bit weird when he gets out and you have to shake the controller to dry him off with a towel..The 2nd scene is when you play with Madison, she'll have an OPTION to take a shower, in which she takes off her clothes, walks into the walk-in shower, and it shows her breasts and butt, that's all.Again, it may seem like they're going to show more than that, but they won'tIt all depends on your views.This scene isn't needed to get a trophy; you don't even have to go into her bathroom at ALL to beat that chapter.The 3rd scene, however, IS needed to get a trophy, seeing that there's something that happens after the fact, and depending on your actions, will earn a trophy.I won't say who, but you're given the choice to kiss a person, or not to kiss.If you kiss the person, then they'll start having some sex! xD But no, what they really do is start kissing, then lay on the floor. You'll have some INTERACTION with the scene, like to either unhook so and sos Bra, or to change position...The only nudity they show in this scene is so and sos Right breast, I'm not sure if they show any butt, but yeah...Depending on your views, this might be something to run home about. And I can say, it's kinda awkward if someone is watching you play, however, it does change the story/ending depending on which you choose. So, good luck with-a-THAT.There are a few bugs, such as during a movie scene where characters are talking to each other, and then some people that are walking around will just walk straight through the characters or any object, such as a desk or wall.I can say that it's really weird when it happens, but it's only a few times during the whole game, and ruins nothing at all.There are also some weird times where the characters facial expression doesn't quite match the situation...You'd know when you see it.It may sound like there are just bugs and problems at every which way, but it's only a few, and is spread out through the whole game, and by the time you encounter one, you'd have forgotten about the previous ones.(*5*) OVERALL - 10At the end of the day, I give this game a 10; because of how the story is told, and what the game makes you feel for the characters is just too realistic. And for a GAME to make me actually fear the outcome and possible regret of a situation is just wonderful. And even though I said the game gets a bit boring after the 3rd or so play through, this is still a game that should not be passed by. If like me, you'll connect to the characters. At first, I didn't like Norman Jayden, and had liked Ethan the most, but after I played it again, I started liking Norman more and more.This is an Action/Adventure, Drama, Mystery/Crime, and Romance.I really hope that this game has created a new genre of games, as I also loved Indigo Prophecy.There just aren't enough, if any, games like this, and have added Quantic Dreams to my list of favorite companies.I hope this review helped.\n",

      "Ryse: Son of Rome is easily the best looking game I've ever played on a console. Hands down. I wish I could compare it to something, but I really can't. Every graphical detail is superb. There are certain moments in the game that you take a pause from slaying barbarians just to take in the beauty of the environments you find yourself fighting in. This, and Battlefield 4, are absolutely the best looking games out right now for the Xbox One, and the only games in the current line up that give you that &#34;next generation&#34; feel as you play through them.The gameplay in Ryse: Son of Rome is great, but its not for every type of gamer. If you're into the type of games where you just slash through and brutalize all of your assailants, than this game is for you. You get to perform some of the absolute most gnarliest finishes/executions I've ever seen on any game outside of Mortal Kombat. And its done in a very smooth, fluid manner. As your playing through most of the game your using your attack buttons( X and Y) for most of the combat. After you've stunned your opponent, or just beat him to a pulp you can press the RT(right trigger on Xbox one, of course)to enter into the execution &#34;mode&#34;. The camera zooms in, the action slows down, and you use either the X or Y button to absolutely tear apart your adversary. The feeling you get is a lot like the scenes in the movie 300 where they break phalanx and you see Leonidas taking out individual bad guys by himself. You can even set up a situation where you perform two executions on two enemies at once! It has a real movie quality and makes you feel like you're playing through a movie than through a game. I'm actually short of words to describe just how awesome this is if you're an epic action movie type fan like myself.The storyline is also fantastic. I don't want to get too much into detail because I don't want to spoil the game, but I will tell you that story takes you all over Europe, and you get to face some really awesome opponents and fight in some truly gorgeous and/or creepy settings. For instance, do you remember the bear like people from the movie the 13th warrior? If you do, you'll be really excited to see that you infiltrate a village of a tribe of people that look and act just like those guys. You even get to fight under a giant wicker man to save your men and one of your superiors. There's much more than just the stages for the epic battles you'll be fighting, though. You go through Roman cities, fight in the Roman colosseum(so awesome) and much more. But more importantly, the story is engaging and entertaining, especially if you're into ancient Roman history even a little bit. Of course, I'm not saying the story is from actual Roman history, but it allows you to get a feel for what being a Roman centurion might have felt like when Rome was starting to crumble.I would say that there is a moderate replay value with Ryse: Son of Rome. I've played through the story twice, and I had fun doing it both times. The first play through was just me experiencing the game for the first time and taking it all in. I was so impressed with the game as a whole that I decided I wanted to play through again and try to really take advantage of everything the games combat system has to offer. Not only did I find some things that i missed in the first play through, I also had a really good time playing through the game because I had full command over all of the abilities that the character has to offer. You get to keep your acquired upgrades and skills from the first campaign, and so when you start the second campaign your centurion is much more powerful, and it really gives the game a different feel. With all of that said, I probably won't be playing through a third time unless I have a friend or something that wants to play it with me.There is a multiplayer mode that is decent, but I don't think it was intended to be a main feature of the game anyway. Like I said, its okay. You're basically fighting like a gladiator in the multiplayer. Nothing special, really.There are some drawbacks to the game as well.First and foremost, the game can get a little repetitive for those that don't like hack and slash titles where the focus is mostly on brutal violence and finishing moves. There aren't a ton of combos you can do, and while there are several different executions, I think there are probably only 20 or so in total so it doesn't take long to see them all. And they don't change as you play through the game. There are some instances where you get to use the environment in the executions, but all in all you get the same 20 or so over and over again, and you don't get to choose which ones you perform. It would have been great to be able to use the upgrade system to buy executions and finishing moves, and maybe some more significant upgrades and abilites(like the ability to throw a sword stolen from another enemy, etc). I could see a lot of people who are looking for a deeper gaming experience being a bit disappointed with Ryse in this respect. Honestly, for me, the brutal executions and great graphics made up for it pretty well.Second, and this might just be me, but I think the game could have been a bit longer. Sure, with the amount of epic action and beautiful environments it probably took the team designing and building this game years to complete. I have no doubt about that at all, But the whole game is like ten hours long, and while there is a lot of substance and fun in those ten hours, there isn't enough of it to completely satisfy my desire for barbarian blood and digital violence. This might speak to why I wanted to play through a second time.I think my last gripe is that you see the same types of enemies through out the entire game. Towards the end you start fighting fellow Roman soldiers and a few gladiators, but for the most part you see the same three enemies rendered the same exact way over and over again. It seems like it wouldn't be that hard to come up with a few different looks to keep things interested.For the most part, I think Ryse: Son of Rome is probably the flagship xbox one launch(BF4 loses out here due to multiplayer issues plaguing the release) title due to the amazing graphics and movie-like nature of the gameplay. When you're playing through the game and time slows down for one of those vicious finishing moves you're going to get the same feeling that you did when you watched the slo mo sequences in 300 or gladiator. And for most action movie fanatics, this will be enough to cement Ryse as one of the best games you've every played. Add the entertaining story line, the stunning backgrounds and levels you'll fight in, the sheer level of digital violence and you've got a real winner in my opinion. I whole heartedly recommend this to anyone that enjoys combat based games, time piece games, button mashers, beautiful graphics, and any game with a very high level of raw brutality. I think you'll find this game to be unlike anything you've ever played before. It is a true next generation game.On the other hand, if you're looking for deep character customization, historical accuracy, a game where you don't hit the same two or three buttons over and over again, or if you don't enjoy excessive carnage and blood in a video game, this game is not for you.\n",

      "I'd like to take a look at the game LA Noire which came out all the way back in the spring of 2011 released by Rockstar Games and developed by Team Bondi. Now I didn't get to play it till earlier this year in 2012 and I found myself regretting not playing this game when it came out because it totally deserved a place on my top 5 games of 2011. At first glance, this game looks like another GTA clone but it is far from it. It is a deep and immersive game that truly makes you feel like a detective in a film-noire crime movie. It received high scores in reviews and rightfully so but I still know lots of people who have never played this, myself almost being one of them. This is one of those games that anyone who considers themselves a gamer needs to experience.STORY: Set in Los Angeles in 1946, you play mostly as Cole Phelps, a Battle of Okinawa veteran and new beat cop with the LAPD.  Phelps' keen problem solving skills get him noticed by the police chief and heads of the detective desks in the police department and after while (four missions that act as the game's tutorial) he is promoted to detective. Throughout the game, you work multiple cases from the traffic desk, homicide desk, vice desk, and arson desk. Not to go into any spoilers but you will deal with murders, insurance frauds, serial killers, the mafia, drug rings, and scandals including Phelps' hurtles as he rises to become one of the most well known and feared detectives in LA. One of the things that makes this game work is how painstakingly detailed Los Angeles is. Team Bondi put in a lot of hard work to recreate 1946 Los Angeles, not just in physical appearance (you can go anywhere in the city as it was during that time) but also in the social issues that were going on at the time. Racism, sexism, and veterans adjusting to peace time create some of the strongest images I've ever seen of post-WWII America and it all just sucks you deeper and deeper into this game. Be warned: the murder scenes in this game are brutally realistic but once again it just adds to the feeling of being a detective. The gameplay, acting, and sound also greatly play into making this game an unforgettable experience.GAMEPLAY: Like I said before, it looks and generally plays like a GTA game however the best aspects of the gameplay does not focus on running and gunning like most similar games before it. Let me make this clear, if you pick up this game expecting an action game you will be very disappointed. This is a thinker's game and that's what makes it so great. You will be rattling your brain trying to put together the clues you've gather and trying to figure out who is lying and telling the truth. This is the core of the gameplay and it gets really tricky as the game progresses. Each time you visit a crime scene you will need to make sure to explore every inch of the area and examine everything. You have a notepad in which notes are made through your investigations and you'll want to use them during questionings and interrogations. The more clues you've gathered, the more you'll have to work with. Interrogations are the other big part of the game and you will be racking your brain with some of these. As you ask your questions, you must determine whether or not they are telling the truth, lying, or give doubt to what they are saying. You'll probably notice how realistic everyone's facial animations look in this game. That's not just to make to game look good, it's a gameplay mechanic. Part of what you will be using to judge if someone is telling the truth or not is by watching their facial expressions. This gets really tricky but is so satisfying when you're able to catch someone in their own lie.Now like I said, getting interrogations to come out the way you want them can be really hard but there is help. You gain intuition points throughout the game by successfully questioning someone and/or getting a good cop grade when completing a case. You can use these during interrogations to take away some of the options to help you deduce if someone is telling the truth or not. I found myself trying to use these as sparingly as possible mainly because, while this gameplay mechanic is challenging, it is very rewarding and fun to try and figure out which, once again, plays into the immersive feel of this game and making you really feel like a detective. Help also comes to you during your investigations in the form of the partners that you get throughout the game. While some are more helpful than others, you can always go talk to them about what you should do next. The game missions are actually very linear however you don't really notice it since the entire city is there to explore but you will feel driven to go to your next objective and what not which makes the missions feel more open than they really are. There is a lot of replay value to each case as they can have multiple outcomes based on how well you do with your investigation. However, the outcome, no matter how bad, doesn't really affect the overall story at all which is a shame because this was a game that could have used more than one ending.Driving is another big part of the game. There are nearly 100 actual car models that would have been on the road in 1946 that you can find and drive. Like in similar games, you'll want to go as fast as you can all the time and end up crashing into everything because no one else is driving like that. In this game, that's not the best idea as it can hurt your case performance points though there is a free drive mode where driving like a mad man won't count against you and it is fun for mindless road rage. Of course, you do find yourself in car chases throughout the game and they can be frustrating at times. Not knowing your way around in a case can lead you into a dead end or getting caught on the corner of a wall or something as your target speeds away that can lead to a failure of the mission and restart at the last check point. However, this is something that is common in open sandbox type games so it's nothing unique to LA Noire. There are also foot chases where you have to chase down a suspect. This tends to happen a lot and it gets kind of annoying each time it happens. Much like with the car chases, if you get lost and lose your target, its game over. The action segments in general in LA Noire are not handled too well and hard kind of rare for what you'd expect from a game like this. They are there but they are much more spread out throughout the game. The shooting mechanic is pretty bare bones and while it is simple enough, it doesn't happen so much so I was usually taken back when I had to try and remember how the shooting worked because you just don't use it that often. There are even some platform action segments which can be pretty difficult as well. This game does let you skip past these action parts if you die too many times but I personally find that kind of cheap though I did find myself using it once. Like I said, action is not what this game excels at, this is thinker's game and that is what sets LA Noire apart from other similar games and what it does so well and makes this game so memorable.GRAPHICS: What you will notice that stands out the most is the facial animations for all the characters in this game. MotionScan technology was developed for completely capturing the faces of the game actors, capturing every single movement of someone's face. What we get is true acting in a video game, not just voice acting over the animation of a game character. Something like this has never really been done before. The sites of Los Angeles such as landmarks and other locations were recreated for this game and look amazing. The crime scenes, apartments and houses are very well furnished and look like someplace someone would actually live instead of just decoration for the game. Like I said the facial animations will steal the show but there is a lot to look at when you're not too busy with investigations.SOUND: The music in this game is just great. The jazz and big band type music from the time period makes for a beautiful and fitting soundtrack and is the icing on the cake. The sound effects all sound great and work into the gameplay as well. When doing investigations of crime scenes, as you walk past a clue, a piano chime will play by the object letting you know to check that object out. It helps you inspect things that do not appear as obvious some other things at the crime scene. The voice acting, my god, this is flat out some of the best voice work for a video game I've ever heard and works so well with the facial acting. It really feels like you are part of a movie.Overall, this is a game I feel has sadly become rather underrated since its release.  It truly makes you feel like a detective and really makes you exercise your mind trying to solve these cases, especially if you want to go through and try to get a perfect score on all of these. If you're only into action with games like this, then I'd recommend Sleeping Dogs or a GTA title then. But if you're like me, something like this is a great change of pace from just running around and shooting bad guys. The game has dropped in price a lot so it shouldn't be too hard to find this game for $20 or less if you look hard enough. I highly recommend this game.OVERALL: 9/10\n",

      "I had to write a review for this game because I read some of the negative reviews that it received. First of all, as a fan of The Godfather movies, I really enjoyed this game. It is an improvement over the original game. They fixed a lot of the problems from the first and made some tweaks to the game play. The game play is where this game shines.This game is in the vein of Grand Theft Auto and copies much of the ideas behind it so you will be deciding what to do, how to do it, and when. You actually get to be like the characters in the game. In that sense you are immersed in the Godfather universe.The game falls a bit on the easy side which is a good thing if you are buying this game for a someone who enjoyed the movie or the first game who is not a hard-core gamer. For someone like me, who is not a hard-core gamer, it is a good thing. I don't have the time to become one of those hard-core gamers mind you as I don't spend my days playing video games all day online or otherwise. I do have a life after all. You don't have to run through hoops to get to the next level. Some games can be too difficult and I have encountered my share of those but this one is just right.As far as the graphics are concerned, they are spectacular though not as detailed like let's say Call of Duty Modern Warfare. In my opinion that is one of the best games available but is on the very short side. I completed that game in roughly five hours. If you are mainly concerned with graphics then maybe you should get that game. But if you are looking for fun game play, look no further. The Godfather II has game play covered really well. This is where the game really shines. I found the game to be very engaging and kept me hooked for roughly ten hours which is about par for most video games. The fact that it got me playing it through to the end is an accomplishment in itself as many games do not keep you wanting to come back for more. This is not one of those games that will collect dust on the shelf. As far as replay value, I cannot say that I play a game over once I have completed it. Some people like to play a game over to get all the bonus items but I am not one of those.If you liked the movies and/or the first game, you should check this game out. Right now I notice that the price has been dropped significantly. I think this game is worth more than the price that it is going for right now. I suspect that this game has not sold like other blockbuster games because Electronic Arts did not do a good job of marketing it through the media. Marketing is very important and this game sadly did not get the attention it deserved. Most movie licensed games are not very good as they are basically made as a tie-in to make a quick buck but this one is one of the exceptions. If you were on the fence wondering whether to plunk your hard-earned money on this game, now is the time to get it as now the price is right. You can't go wrong with this game. This game warrants a four-star rating overall.\n",

      "I want to get this out of the way - it's taken me a very long time to get from start to finish of Neverwinter Nights 2, and for good reason.  When the game shipped in 2006 it was all but unplayable for many people because performance was just atrocious.  For this reason, I couldn't get passed the first hour or so of the game; it was just too distracting.  But the state of the game now is not the state of the game as it was at release.  Numerous patches and an expansion pack have made me pick up the game again to give it another try, and I was pleasantly surprised with the game's improvement.Character Creation (not scored)When you first start the game, you'll be taken to the Character Creation screen.  There are many, many, options for you when you start character creation, and I'm not just referring to what color hair your character has.  So much so that it's overwhelming.  In fact, I almost didn't get into the game at all because I didn't know what to do.  There isn't really a tutorial or anything to help you figure it all out; instead, the game just gives you paragraphs of information on the right side of the screen detailing complicated, esoteric Dungeons and Dragons jargon.  I will revisit this problem later when I talk about game-play, for it is a problem that permeates the game - in order to get the most out of the game you really need to have a pre-requisite knowledge of the way D&D; works.  It wasn't anywhere near as overwhelming in the original game or Baldur's Gate or other D&D; based games - the game worked with or without your own personal experience with the game's systems.  So when the game describes dice rolls, and stat offsets without explaining what they mean, it alienates the less hardcore consumer who hasn't spent half their life in a dank basement rolling for initiative.  In the end, I just chose one of the pre-set character customization options or else I never would have gotten started.  I will say, though, for the aforementioned D&D; fanatic, the options and classes are very deep and varied; just don't expect for the game to cut you any slack, at first at least.Story 8/10This is one of the game's biggest strengths.  Within the main campaign, you will easily find 50+ hours worth of playtime.  The game takes place in the Forgotten Realms, more specifically the Sword Coast.  You play a guy/girl/creature from a small southern swamp town, with an unknown destiny.  There is an attack on your town at the beginning of the game, leading you to discover said destiny and set off on an epic journey to the city of Neverwinter and beyond.  The set-up is very familiar, but the execution is top-notch.  There is political betrayal and intrigue, racial tension and other problems to contend with that help make the world feel alive and vibrant.The game also employs use of a good/evil alignment system that attempts to make character interaction more interesting, but it doesn't have any effect on the story at large - you'll still end up battling the same final boss, and you'll either win or lose.  Which brings me to the main problem with the campaign: its linearity.  The world is large, but you'll discover it in a very linear manner.  There are side quests, but for the most part, they are just optional objectives to fulfill along the main story arc, rather than allowing you to explore other parts of the Sword Coast.Game-play 8/10Game-play is exactly what you would expect of a D&D; game.  The difference between the original and the sequel, though, is that you control an entire party of four people rather than just one.  You have complete control over your henchmen, rather than having the game automate all of their actions.  The AI does control  them when you want them to, but you have the option of micro-managing every action and level up.Battle consists of giving orders to your characters, watch them act out those orders, hitting the space bar to pause the game, giving more orders and doing it all over again.  It isn't really any different that it has been in games like Baldur's Gate, but why fix what isn't broken?  It's fun, engaging, and the reason to play the game.  If you didn't like it before, you won't like it here, but it's dungeon crawling at its finest.The game gives you a rather slow-moving, basic tutorial at the beginning of the game to orient you with the way combat works.  It sort of does its job, but once again, the game doesn't really teach you the way D&D; works.  So you either learn it elsewhere or ignore the underlying mechanisms, but it will make you feel like you don't understand what's really going on if you do just ignore it.  The idea behind having a computer version of a D&D; game is to automate it for you, but I felt alienated by being kept in the dark, and I often didn't know how to play different classes.Also, it is FAR easier to play as a melee-oriented class than a caster.  Because you need to rest constantly to recharge spells, you won't always have your basic spells to use on your foes.  When your casters have leveled enough, this will cease to be a problem, but if you start out as a mage, expect to rest after every encounter for the first 8 or 9 hours of the game.  Also, you won't be able to manage any kind of aggro, so be prepared to need a fighter or warrior to get through most battles.  This is part of the challenge of the game and the nature of D&D;, but playing a fighter really is a breeze, while playing a sorcerer can be an exercise in frustration.  Also, the AI is okay, but you'll notice sorcerers using their most powerful spells on rats when just a magic missile will do.  As such, you'll probably want to order around all of your characters rather than trusting the AI.  Inventory management can be clunky, too, but you generally have plenty of space for everything you want to pick up and sell.All of these issues are often minor, though, and playing the game is a blast most of the time.  After a few hours you'll get a handle on how everything works, and it'll start to feel more natural.  Later in the game you gain control of a fortress, which is yours to reinforce and work on, hire soldiers for, etc., which is also really engaging.Performance 6/10And here we reach the biggest issue with the game.  The game just wasn't programmed to perform well on most systems.  Especially considering the level of graphical detail inherent in the game design, performance is downright awful.  Framerates rarely exceeded 15fps for me, and I have a gigabyte of video memory and two gigs of ram.  The game has a particularly difficult time dealing with SLi or multi-core processors, which may have resulted from the game's lengthy development period.  The patches and updates have made a big difference, but since then huge game-breaking bugs have reared their ugly heads.By far the biggest bug is one where the game actually deletes party members from your roster.  It wouldn't be such a huge issue if certain campaign events didn't require you to have specific characters in your party at the time.  See, the game stores character information every time you change scenery.  However, when you have a familiar summoned, it will overwrite your useful tiefling thief or dwarf fighter, or what have you, with that familiar, effectively losing said character.  It requires clunky file manipulation or a game restart, to fix  which almost made me give up the game after 35 hours of playing.  It is inexcusable to have such an enormous bug in the game a year and a half after release still in its code.  Also, in order sidestep said bug, you have to unsummon all creatures every time you leave a scene, which is just irritating.  Patch documentation state that this has been addressed, but this is a flat-out lie; I started a new game after all the latest updates had been installed.Graphics 7/10Even with the game's poor performance, the game looks okay.  It kind of gets away with it much of the time because it doesn't require twitch action from the player.  The backgrounds are pretty, with certain districts of Neverwinter being almost beautiful.  The spell effects are the highlight of the game, with firebolts, mage missiles, and ice balls being flung all over the place during combat.  It's very pleasant to look at while fighting, and satisfying when a meteor storm obliterates a boss character.However the characters look like they fell out of a time warp circa 2001.  They often look awful, and the hair is particularly bad.  I would expect character models of this caliber on the PSP, not on PCs.  Also, the graphics engine is buggy, with random flickering happening quite frequently.  Again, this all depends on your setup, but it is the norm, rather than the exception,  if forum dwellers are to be believed.  Loading times are very high, framerates are low, and bugs abound.  The camera is particularly suspect - it's kind of isometric, kind of over the shoulder, but you there is no automation whatsoever, so plan on constantly manually moving it to get a better view of the action.  Even more frustrating is the fact that it doesn't save where you were last looking with it when you transition to a new area, so you end up with an awful view every time you gain control of your characters.  I don't know what was wrong with the way the original camera worked, but it detracts from the game experience.Sound 9/10I don't really have any criticism here.  The voice acting is of high-quality across the board, the orchestral music is compelling and fitting, and the sound effects are satisfying.  This is easily the most consistent part of the game.SummaryAll of the issues can really creep up on you while you play, and it's unfortunate that there are so many of them because there truly is a lot of fun to be had here for the persistent.  All of this isn't really new to PC gamers, who are used to doing all kinds of tweaking to get games to work, but a history of this doesn't exclude Obsidian from the responsibility of releasing such an unpolished an inconsistent piece of software.  That having been said, once I got the game working at a stable rate, I had a great time discovering and becoming part of its world and the tale it has to tell.  The bottom line is that it's fun, engaging, and deep.  Keep in mind the bugs and problems you may encounter before making a purchase, but it has my recommendation.Pros:-Engaging story-Great sound-Fun, deep gameplay-Lengthy campaignCons:-Extremely inconsistent performance-Mediocre graphics-Difficult to get started-Complicated game systems-Lack of in-game explanation of those systemsOverall Score - 8/10\n",

      "You know it's hard to pull off a sequel,especially when the original does so well....not in Bioshock 2 :)In Bioshock 2 there's all new parts of the city of Rapture to explore and this time you play as a big daddy.The only comparison between the first and second Bioshock was the first Bioshock struck me as more dark,weird, and edgy while the second Bioshock struck me more as dark and weird without the scary elements of surprise from the first.Yet Bioshock 2 didn't dissapoint me the slightest bit,lots of interesting areas with fluid-like graphics.One of the the things I have to mention about the Bioshock games is the games are long,it's not all show.\n",

      "Or so it would seem. How can you top Bioshock? It would seem like an impossible task. But Ken Levine and Irrational thrive when being challenged. Similar to his days at Looking Glass and the critical success of System Shock 2, Ken Levine and Irrational floored people with Bioshock. When Bioshock released in 2007, its creativity made people notice the work of Irrational in a more mainstream capacity, giving Irrational a lot more credibility with publishers, which would ultimately lead to many, many years of developments on Infinite. Was the wait worth it? Two words: Hell yes!Bioshock Infinite is a Bioshock game, period. I know it looks different and may seem different, but a lot of the things from Bioshock are in Bioshock Infinite. While Infinite has its own look and everything, which makes it feel new and fresh, this is a Shock game through and through, so you have a mix of the familiar with something entirely new. The combat is very similar to the first game, but guns have more of a kick this time around. Plasmids also make a comeback in the form of Vigors, which allow for a lot of variation and experimentation in combat. There's also the inclusion of sky-lines, which make some fights really exciting and frantic. I'd say the combat scenarios are an improvement from the first Bioshock. You'll also be looting the environment and corpses for money, food, salt (for Vigors), etc.Bioshock's art direction is simply stunning. It takes a very talented art team to pull off something like Infinite, and the team at Irrational was definitely up to the task. The amount of detail in each and every environment is staggering. You'll definitely understand why this game was such an undertaking and took so many years to create when you see it in action. Then you have Elizabeth, which is one of the most realized characters in all of gaming. Elizabeth's animations and interactions are one of Infinite's many highlights.But Bioshock Infinite is ultimately all about the narrative, which it delivers on from beginning to end. This game's story is hands down one of the best in the business, even going as far as surpassing the original Bioshock. While Bioshock was a masterpiece, its ending left a little something to be desired. But this isn't the case with Bioshock Infinite. This game has an ending that'll blow you away.Irrational chose the impossible, they chose Infinite. Would you kindly buy this game immediately?\n",

      "I have always loved the Bioshock franchise, but with Bioshock Infinite, the developers took the game to a higher dimension. The game presents very strong graphics, captivating story, incredible character development and a climactic ending that will leave you guessing for days to come.  If you have not played the previous Bioshock games, I suggest you play the first Bioshock (you can skip Bioshock 2, no problem) before you play the Infinite.Believe me; you will see why I make that suggestion.\n",

      "The first Bioshock game was a poorly-balanced and rough shooter, but the worldbuilding and narrative was superb.  The second Bioshock was a much better shooter, but the worldbuilding was a little weaker because everything had been established perfectly in the first game.  Bioshock Infinite is neither a good shooter, and its worldbuilding and writing is sloppy.  For example, systems from the first games were brought over willy-nilly without any real justification -- plasmids, so critical to the story and economy of the world of Rapture, are now &#34;Vigors&#34; in Infinite's Columbia...and they're just there.  They just exist because they were there, you know, in the first game.  Another example: your character still gets healthy by eating stuff out of garbage cans, or is just as likely to find a hot dog in a chocolate box.  This scavenging worked in conflict-torn Rapture, but doesn't in this game.  There's many other things that don't make sense in this game, narratives that are drawn up and then just as hastily abandoned, the pacing of exploration and combat lurches unevenly.  It's clear that what we ended up with in Bioshock Infinite is a patchwork of ideas assembled at the last minute.All that being said, Bioshock Infinite is not a bad game; it's just not up to the standards of the previous two Bioshocks.  If you're willing to overlook the holes and sigh through the WTFs, you get a serviceable Bioshock 2.5 in a sometimes interesting new environment, and if you're into steampunk art then you'll love Infinite's art direction.  There are a couple of powerful moments in the game -- interestingly enough, they're ancillary to the plot as opposed to the legendary &#34;Would you kindly&#34; reveal.  I'm also impressed that the game designers were willing to go as far as they did with exploring turn-of-the-20th-century racism as much as they did.TL;DR version: Bioshock Infinite is one, long uneven escort quest -- only the game's main NPC escorts YOU.  Pity the poor lass.\n",

      "This game is about to get a lot of attention, more attention than it's had in the years since its Spring 2000 US release. Final Fantasy XII looms on the horizon, and it's the creative vision of Yasumi Matsuno. Vagrant Story is another of Matsuno's brainchildren. Once FFXII has been out for a couple of weeks and everybody's beaten it, a lot of those people are going to find out about Vagrant Story for the first time and go scrambling over to eBay to get a copy. This review is for them.Almost everything about Vagrant Story is par excellance. The story, the script, the characters, the graphics, the soundtrack... The English translation is especially spectacular, due to its masterful coloring with \"Olde English\" which adds so much flavor to the tone and atmosphere. This is one of the ultra rare cases where the English translation is arguably far superior to the original Japanese script. Unfortunately, all of these shining examples of fine craft and \"video game design as true art\" is all for naught because of one single fatal flaw: The game simply isn't fun to play.Where the game ultimately fails is in the game play. First of all, the game is extremely focused. It's all dungeon crawling and fighting. There are no towns to explore and shop in, no NPCs to talk to, no minigames. Once you enter the dungeon, that's it. You will progress through different areas and get a change in scenery from time to time, but there is almost no variety in the gameplay. You move from room to room, you solve the occasional crate puzzle, and you fight enemies. End of story.The battle system in and of itself is fine. It's an interesting hybrid cross between standard real time action combat and traditional RPG turn based combat. The problem is, at the very heart of the battle system is an abysmally UN-fun weapon and armor system. There are several (eight?) classes of enemies in the game- Beast, Human, Dragon, Undead, Phantom, etc. The enemy classes are paired off into diametric oppositions. e.g. Using your weapon against a human enemy will make it stronger against humans, but weaker against phantoms. (sic) On top of that, there are specific weakness ratings. An enemy might be weak against blunt weapons, but almost totally impervious to edged weapons or piercing weapons. And then there are the usual elementals as well- fire, ice, earth and so on. Finally, each of your weapons has its own \"wear\" rating. The lower the rating, the more worn out the weapon, the less damage it does. You must repair your weapons in workshops, which are few and far between in the game. Another thing you can do in workshops is disassemble your weapons and reassemble the parts to make new weapons. Whether the new weapon will be better or worse than the weapons you sacrificed to make them involves much trial and error. The end effect of all of this is that as you play the game, you are literally constantly changing weapons. Yet the creators of the game didn't bother to implement any sort of quick menu for weapon switching, a la Secret of Mana. You have no choice but to spend 45% of your game time opening the main menu, opening the weapon menu, finding the right weapon, opening the accessory menu, changing the elemental jewels on the weapon, etc. etc. etc. All they had to do was come up with some sort of quick menu for changing weapons, as Seiken Densetsu 2 did seven years earlier. As it stands, Vagrant Story is a micro-management nightmare. To call the game tedious is an understatement of epic proportions. There are those who insist that a viable alternative is simply slogging your way through the game using whatever weapons you happen to have, whether they're effective or not. It can be done, but it makes the game even less fun. Why anyone would want to take on a boss with several thousand HP by doing only 1-3 points of damage per hit is beyond me.As is always the case, no matter how flawed a game may be, there will be a small niche group of vocal supporters who insist that it's the greatest game ever created, and that people who don't like it just don't \"get it.\" Beware of misguided fanatics. But hey, then again you just might end up being part of the 5% of people who play this game and come away thinking it's the bee's knees.EDIT- Apparently the star ratings aren't displayed exactly as they were input. I gave Vagrant Story ** (2/5) for \"Fun\" and **** (4/5) \"Overall.\"\n",

      "I have played a few horror games and this one is pretty decent.PROS:-The graphics are pretty well done, although you will spend most of the time in the dark metro tunnels, the graphics stand out whenever they need to.-Second off, what everyone wants to know...does it scare you? Yes it does, like every other horror FPS, it has those sudden moments. Hearing random creatures howling or crawling around you keeps your senses sharp. I found myself almost hoping that I'd have human enemies as the new mission loaded because they're easier to kill!-The game introduces new elements that try to immerse you into the game. For example, you have a flashlight that will dim out with time, the game gives you a sort of charger that you have to manually pump for the light to be bright again. Same thing with the pressure pump for weapons (these are gotten later in the game) and the gas mask canisters whenever you are walking around in the surface.-How well does it play? It plays beautifully. At first you'll be lost as to all the things you have to manage, but with curiosity and hints from the game you'll be able to grasp all the tasks that you need to be aware of whenever playing. This does not guarantee the game will get any easier though, it will still post a challenge, be it trying to find the right way, trying to survive with a broken mask and low canisters, or fighting those damn beasts! Definitely worth the buy.-This is more of a tip, whenever there is a weapon on the ground it HAS AMMO in it. So if you have no ammo and you happen to find a weapon, pick it up right away! Another tip, if you swap a weapon (ex: an Assault Rifle with 20 rounds in the clip) for another weapon (ex: Pistol with 2 rounds in the clip), that first weapon will lay on the floor with those 20 rounds still in the clip AND if the second weapon is reloaded and swapped back (for the Assault Rifle), the second weapon will not give you back the rounds you loaded into its chamber. In other words, if you ever see a weapon you want, make sure the weapon you're swapping it for is low on ammo, that way you don't lose much when you swap them out.CONS (although I do have issues with some things in the game, they are not game breaking by any means).-The &#34;radar;&#34; although pulling it up is quite unique and the game is mostly linear at times, sometimes the arrow points you in the direction you need to go, but it there are no hints as to how to get through certain roadblocks. This might not be an issue while you are in the tunnels, as &#34;getting lost&#34; is sort of rewarded most of the time with ammo, life or canisters, but when you're out in the surface and your canister is running out, it becomes an issue.-The missions at the beginning are pretty short and boring. Even though the game is trying to immerse you into the story and trying to make you catch up, the very few missions are pretty stale, they do pick up in length and exploring as you progress though.-Amount of weapons carried; I played Metro on regular difficulty and it still posted a bit of a challenge at times. The stealth kills are tons of fun but there are times where you have to go guns blazing, this becomes an issue because ammo is usually scarce and being able to carry ONLY 3 guns becomes a challenge. At some point I found myself trying to knife my way out of a boss fight, all because I had to fight like 5 or 6 waves of beasts...which don't give you ammo when killed. Even though they have 4 types of alternate weapons (stealth knives, frag pipes, incendiary frag pipes and claymores) these are a rare find as well (although stealth knives can be picked up from bodies or the floor if you're able to find them again).-The...currency? The currency in this game is rather odd, it's a special type of ammo which can be found scattered around the metro and surface areas. Finding it takes some exploring and that's where the game shines (I wish they had done a little more of an open world, but oh well). It is scarce as well, the good thing is that you can swap it to an Assault Rifle and use it if you run out of all ammunition, also it allows you to buy new weapons, refill ammo, and buy alternate weapons (see below).-The last con, although not horrible, it strikes me odd as to why they didn't put this. Whenever you see a weapon on the ground an icon appears showing you the weapon and its attachments, but nothing tells you the name or the stats of it. It would be helpful to know if I'm picking up a weapon that's better or worse than the one I currently have, otherwise, why have varied weapons to begin with?\n",

      "After three incredibly successful games in the form of Tomb Raider, Tomb Raider 2 and Tomb Raider 3, Lara Croft returned in November 1999 with Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation. The previous two games didn't really live up to the title of 'Tomb Raider' as there weren't many tombs involved at all, but The Last Revelation takes advantage of its trademark name by putting Lara back into the tombs - where she belongs! This was the third Tomb Raider game I bought, after Tomb Raider and Tomb Raider 2, and I have to say it is one of the most exciting and enjoyable games I have ever played. The Offical PlayStation Magazine says, \"10/10 - An atmospheric, beautiful, wonderfully crafted game\". And you know what? They're absolutely right...The story of The Last Revelation is very intricate - gripping, without being too unbelievable. While exploring Egypt, Lara discovers the lost tomb of the Ancient Egyptian God, Set. He was outwitted and imprisoned in a secret tomb, and warns that he will one day return to seek vengance. Lara unwittingly unleashes its ancient evil, fulfilling the prophecy that threatens to plunge mankind into eternal darkness! In a race against time, Lara must use all her wit and skill to re-imprison Set to save the world from unspeakable evil and Armageddon! The Last Revelation begins with a flashback level from the 1980's when Lara was 16 on her first exploration in Angkor Wat, Cambodia. She is led around by her mentor, Werner Von Croy. This is really just a training level that teaches new Tomb Raider players the ropes on how to control Lara. After this, the game really begins - in the present day. We learn that on their escape from the tomb in Cambodia, Lara left Von Croy to die after the tomb began to collapse around her. It's not long, however, until we find out that Mr Von Croy is indeed alive and well, and on the look out for Lara to get revenge! The game is split into six different sections; Training Levels, Recovering the Amulet of Horus, Discovering the Truth, The Search for the Armor, The Search for Jean-Pierre and The Final Conflict. This game has been giving a rating of 11+, but I think it should be at least a 15+ because the graphics are much better than the first two games, making everything look more life like. I admit that some of the levels on this game, especially towards the end scared me to death! I used to sit there with both eyes squinted, scrwaming my head off as the sweat used to pour from my hands...pretty sad when you think about it now! Despite this, the levels are amazingly intricate and full of life and colour - much more detailed than any of the games in the series. Since the game is set entirely in Egypt, you get a real feel to what life is like over there and almost become part of the game. This game took me nine months to complete (December 1999-September 2000) and I have to say that I enjoyed every second of it! Lara has a variety of new features and you also have to go back and forth between levels to find a particular object that will open the door to the finale. The cut-scenes that run through the entire game to tell the story are absolutely mind-blowing. The graphics are brilliant - it's just like watching a film...and Lara's boobs seem to get bigger as the series goes along! The last level truly is one of the greatest, most spectacular levels in video gaming history which involves a confrontation with the God Set! In the final cut-scene of the game, Lara is seen exiting the crumbling tomb to find Von Croy at the entrance. Emotion takes over and he puts out his hand, but it's too late. The tomb collapses with Lara still inside. This really was a tense moment for Tomb Raider fanatics as they were left wondering if this was it for Lara, if there favourite compuiter game series was over for good. They need not have worried as Tomb Raider: Chronicles and Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Angel Of Darkness followed!OVERALL GRADE: 10/10All in all, Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation is a must-have game for Tomb Raider fans and for anyone who enjoys computer games in general. But be warned, this game requires a lot of time, effort and determination. If you want to get everything right on the first time, you're best off not buying this game because you'll just hate it. Yet for people who want an exciting, suspenseful, thrilling, action-packed blockbuster of a video game, Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation is the game for you! Buy it now from Amazon!\n",

      "Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga is the third and latest game in the Super Mario RPG series. Any fan of either Super Mario RPG or Paper Mario should give this game a try, as it is very similar in game play to the other two. The obvious difference is this time, you get to use both Mario and Luigi in your quest.It's a conventional RPG with turn based battles, character upgrades and the like. But instead of the usual plot of Bowser-kidnapped-Peach-so-you-better-save-her, you and Bowser will be working together to defeat the evil Cackletta that has stolen Peach's voice.Being an RPG, Superstar Saga will take you a long time to play, it's by no means a quick-beat. Even the game play keeps getting more interesting as you need to master more fighting techniques as you progress.In conclusion, a great RPG, but it doesn't really add much to the genre. If you like RPG's, or was a fan of the original two, you should check it out.\n",

      "My wife bought this game for me, because I love the RPG Mario games.  Paper Mario, Paper Mario the Thousand Year door, and even Mario RPG.  So I sat down and started playing this game, and quickly realized that it is more like the old mario games.  No RPG involved.  It was a little dissapointing, but the game is fun.  There are a ton of levels, and the story is ok, I enjoyed being able to switch to Bowser and Peach as playable characters. I recommend this game to anyone who loves mario games.  If you liked the RPG feel of the other Paper Mario's I do not recommend this game.  Good game, worth a rent and maybe even a buy if you like it.\n",

      "One word can actually encapsulate the overall execution of Mario and Luigi: Superstar Sage.  I hold the word with a dreamlike tone and utter, \"WOW.\"  With slobber and saliva dripping all over my gaming bib and onto my small GBA screen, I know gaming buffs around the world have rejoiced.  After the aged magic that was Super Mario RPG on the beloved SNES and Paper Mario on the N64, Nintendo resurrects the gaming legend once again.  Mario is known to travel in all types of gaming, from Mario Tennis to his true roots of platforming, but as far as his RPG entries are concerned, he never ceased to leave mouths hanging.  His third RPG graces the GBA and I couldn't be more happier since it proves to astound and innovate.  I find it, in every aspect, a rewarding treasure that is much needed in the overpopulated gaming stream.Sometimes the gaming audience needs to take a refreshing break from hammering their wrath on the bad guy attempting to raze the world.  Sometimes gamers need to release tension whether it'd be a hectic job or schedule, and play a lightly driven, amusing game.  And that's where this great RPG glows.  Offering a screwball plotline, this RPG is a refreshing way to start packing up for another multi-hour adventure.  The vile emperor Cackletta has left Princess Peach as a destructive siren, and the notorious Bowser will not grab her until she is cured.  Bower decides to aid Mario and Luigi and treat her, and once that is done, Bowser will fulfill his only purpose in his existence, which is to kidnap the Princess.  So what if the plot is not nerve-busting, the sense of humor welcomingly emanates to fill such a void.  There are a plethora of jokes that mock the Mario franchise itself.  I cracked at the inability of the locales who knew nothing of Luigi, but only the heroics of Mario.  Unlike tons of RPGs, your journey will not be impeded by a mass of dialogue, and when there is some you'll be wanting to read and listen to it develop.The gameplay is so solidly done that it is simply impossible to put the game down.  Many whine that the RPG genre has nothing new under the sun, but this game will make you more than eager to watch the RPG evolution, despite all the common transgressions.  The end results of the game is extraordinary, especially the hallmark gameplay.A hybrid of 2D Zelda on crack and traditional RPG battles, the game grinds both elements into an exquisite twist.  What makes it so different are the options bestowed before the player, both on the battle menu and while navigating dungeon play.  Battle menu aside, Mario and Luigi offers a unique gameplay experience that is extremely inventive.  Both brothers stay together, and each are able to be controlled.  They start off with simple actions, and as the player progresses through the game, both brothers develop abilities to use on  the environment.  Their moves vary, which in turn, access new areas in Beanbean Kingdom.  Each special move is hilarious in its own right, my favorite has to be Mario lighting Luigi's butt on fire, Luigi then rams his way through breakable things in the environment.  The creativity and hilarity booming in the game makes for an extremely hearty experience.The battle engine is wonderfully done.  Borrowing the idea from Super Mario RPG, the GBA installment also has the player timing his button pressing.  If done successfully, the heroes will dodge and counterattack enemy attacks.  With the ordinary choices like item on the menu, the real innovation lies with the single and Bros. attack.  Single attacking allows the player to jump and use an assortment of strikes, while Bros give way to a collective combo.  While leveling up my team, I felt nostalgia encroach upon me.  It enkindled both the Super Mario universe and the incredible reality that Mario is in again, in terrific RPG format.  There are also other elements in the gameplay that make this RPG worth the time, such as the novel power of moustaches!The atmosphere is velvety rich.  Closely matching the graphical nature of Yoshi's Island, another great game for the GBA, the screen is a fine lure into the Mario world.  The vibrant sprites of each character augment the gameplay and experience.  The cast of characters will summon back memories from past Mario games and not to mention new characters alike.  Animation is splendidly brimming with GBA quality all over it.  The environments which mirror all the regions that we've come to know on earth is layered exceedingly well on screen.  Helping to define the mood are the highly notable tunes.  Original nits and bits of classic sounds are back, remixed, and thrown with new catchy whiffs.  Its really surprising to listen to the variety of songs throughout the game.  As a double plus (newspeak), the cast uses their quirks and signature sounds.Do your gaming life a favor, remove yourself form the clich&eacute; of gaming titles and disappointments of this year, and get Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga.  Packing in appealing visuals, sound, and a variety of brilliant gameplay, an RPG hasn't felt this good for quite some time.  I'm particularly tired of graphical de force games that struggle to mirror Hollywood, especially the RPG genre.  It is a sure, safe bet to grab another game starring Mario, the one who probably started your gaming addiction altogether.\n",

      "I'm pretending that the horrible \"Super Mario Sunshine\" game was never made so after the N64 paper Mario game Mario is back. For awile, all we got from him were the bad Mario Party games.  Now we have him how h should be... in a RPG!!!! This is not simalar to the N64 mario RPG Paper Mario becouse this time you play as both Mario and Lugi. It is very funand the best Mario game sence the first. Great replay value andyou will be very, very surprised to see who the final boss is!!!&lt;\n",

      "The Xbox 360 Play & Charge Kit works fairly well, but charging can be a bit inconsistent.  I like that if your last battery is dead it can be plugged into the system to charge while playing.  It will also keep charging after you power the system off (as long as it was in prior to shutting down).  Occasionally I find that the controller will be plugged in with the play & charge kit for hoursm and the battery will still be completely dead when unplugged.  If that same battery is then put into an external charger, it charges and works with no issues.It's a good item to have for those \"just in case\" scenarios. Overall I'm happy with my purchase.  If deciding between either the Play & Charge Kit or the Xbox 360 Quick Charge Kit I would choose the quick charge kit.  Otherwise I would suggest getting both products.\n",

      "Pros-comes with 2 batteries and two chargers-small and easy to use-better then other charge stations out there right now for wii (friend has tried others that are more finicky)Cons-Controller has to sit in charge station in order to charge battery so that controller is out of commission. Ideally,  I would like to be able to disconnect battery, plug into charger and swap new ones in to continue playing.-Doesnt always connect properly to charger, but the charger will still show that its charging. There have been a couple times were I would charge it for a couple of hours pull it off and it is still dead.VerdictWorth getting until something better comes out. I also have the \"quick charge kit\" for the xbox360 and it is 100 times better then this kit (quick charge kit is quicker to charge, longer life, charges without controller attached, always connects). If  Nintendo released their own kit or someone releases a better one, like the quick charge kit, I would throw this one away and buy the new.\n",

      "I bought the Play and Charge kit (which converts your wireless controller into a wired one while the battery is being charged up) when the X360 launched last year.  It does the job, but it takes way too long to recharge the batteries and, while it gave the appearance of charging the batteries while the X360 was in standby mode, that didn't seem to speed the process up all that much.  So, I was hyped when I saw that the Quick Charge kit was coming out and I'm glad I picked one up.Not only can the Quick Charge kit charge up more than one battery at a time, it charges the batteries (at least ) 10 x's faster than the Play and Charge kit.  I've had this kit for two weeks now and I can confirm that it does charge up a spent X360 controller battery in about 2 hours and two in about four.  Most of mine have charged fast than those times, but I've never let one of the batteries totally die before switching it out (the ring of light flashing that the current battery is dying drives me nuts).  The Quick Charge kit comes with one rechargeable battery, so be sure to pick up an extra if you don't already have one.  With at least one extra charged battery @ all times, you should be set.There's not really much else to say about this kit.  It works and it works well.  I would definitely recommend this kit over the Play and Charge kit b/c A) the Quick Charge kit is SO much faster, B) you won't have a recharging controller plugged into the front of your X360 as you would with the Play and Charge kit, and C) I've had some tech issues with the Play and Charge kit. (Sometimes it says the battery is charged, but when I use the battery and check its strength, the X360 dashboard says the battery is only 1/2 charged.  Sure enough, in just a few hours, the ring of light will start to flash again, indicating that the supposedly charged battery is not so charged now.  It doesn't happen every time, but often enough to be annoying.  The Play and Charge kit also seems to take different lengths of time to charge the batteries.  And sometimes, if I leave the controller plugged in, the recharge light will turn back to red after having been green for anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours.  Not so good.)If you own wireless X360 controllers and game a lot, the Quick Charge kit will be worth more to you than 100,000 achievement points.  Check it out!  wb\n",

      "\n",
      "Gambling is hugely popular, especially with tech-savvy criminals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many extortionists are targeting net-based betting firms and threatening to cripple their websites with deluges of data unless a ransom is paid. But now deep defences are being put in place by some of the UK's biggest net firms to stop these attacks. Increasing numbers of attacks and the huge amounts of data being used to try to bump a site off the web are prompting firms to adopt the measures. \"Net firms are realising that it's not just about anti-virus and firewalls,\" said Paul King, chief security architect at Cisco. \"There are more things that can be done in the network to protect data centres.\" Mr King said the only way to properly combat these so-called Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks was with intelligent net-based systems. Many of the gambling sites suffering DDoS attacks are in offshore data and hosting centres, so any large scale data flood could knock out access to many more sites than just the one the criminals were targeting, said Mr King. This overspill effect was only likely to grow as attacks grow in size and scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Malcolm Seagrave, security expert at Energis, said the most common types of attacks hit sites with 10 megabytes of data over short periods of time. Bigger attacks sending down 200 megabytes of traffic or more were rarely seen, he said. \"It does feel like they are turning the dial because you see this traffic gradually growing,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "So far there have been no attacks involving gigabytes of data, said Mr Seagrave. However, he added that it was only a matter of time before such large attacks were mounted. Maria Capella, spokeswoman for net provider Pipex, said that when DDoS attacks were at their height, customers were getting hit every four to five days. The defences being put in place constantly monitor the streams of data flowing across networks and pluck out the traffic destined for target sites. \"It's about understanding what's genuine traffic and keeping attack traffic from going to the site,\" she said. \"We study the profile of their traffic and as soon as we see an anomaly in the profile that's when we start to get the backbone engineering boys to see if we are going to sustain an attack,\" said Ms Capella. This traffic can be hard to spot because DDoS attacks typically use thousands of computers in many different countries, each participating machine only sends a small part of the entire data flood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Typically these computers have been infected by a virus or worm which reports its success and the net address of compromised machines back to the malicious hacker or hi-tech criminal that set off the virus. Hijacked computers are known as zombies or 'bots and collections of them are called 'bot nets. Many spammers rent out 'bot nets to help them anonymously send junk mail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the zombies are based outside the country that hosts the target site so getting the attacking PCs shut off can be difficult. Often Pipex and other net suppliers do get advance notice that an attack is about to happen. \"The serious players tend to precede an attack with some kind of ransom e-mail,\" said Ms Capella. \"We ask, as part of the service we provide, that customers notify us of anything they have in advance that would give us forewarning.\" Once an attack is spotted dedicated net hardware takes over to remove the attack traffic and ensure that sites stay up. Energis took a similar approach, said Mr Seagrave. \"We have technology out there that allows us to detect attacks in minutes rather than let network engineers spend hours pulling the information together,\" said Mr Seagrave. Also net firms were starting to work more closely together on the problem of DDoS attacks and pool information about where they are coming from. Information gathered on attacks and where they originated has led to some arrests. He said Energis also did its own intelligence work to get in insight into which sites criminal gangs plan to target. \"We have people in places where they shouldn't be, monitoring tech sites,\" he said. Sometimes though, he said, spotting the next victim was easy. \"You can see them going alphabetically through the list with the gambling sites, trying one after another,\" said Mr Seagrave.\n",

      "\n",
      "Ask Jeeves has bought the Bloglines website to improve the way it handles content from web journals or blogs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bloglines site has become hugely popular as it gives users one place in which to read, search and share all the blogs they are interested in. Ask Jeeves said it was not planning to change Bloglines but would use the 300 million articles it has archived to round out its index of the web. How much Ask Jeeves paid for Bloglines was not revealed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bloglines has become popular because it lets users build a list of the blogs they want to follow without having to visit each journal site individually. To do this it makes use of a technology known as Really Simple Syndication (RSS) that many blogs have adopted to let other sites know when new entries are made on their journals. The acquisition follows similar moves by other search sites. Google acquired Pyra Labs, makers of the Blogger software, in 2003. In 2004 MSN introduced its own blog system and Yahoo has tweaked its technology to do a better job of handling blog entries. Jim Lanzone, vice president of search properties at Ask Jeeves in the US, said it did not acquire Bloglines just to get a foothold in the blog publishing world. He said Ask Jeeves was much more interested in helping people find information they were looking for rather than helping them write it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The universe of readers is vastly larger than the universe of writers,\" he said. Mr Lanzone said the acquisition would sit well with Ask's My Jeeves service which lets people customise their own web experience and build up a personal collection of useful links. \"Search engines are about discovering information for the first time and RSS is the ideal way to keep track of and monitor those sites,\" he said. It would also help drive information and entries from blogs to the portals that Ask Jeeves operates. There would be no instant sweeping changes to Bloglines, said Mr Lanzone. \"Our intent is to take our time to figure out the right business model not to try to monetise it right away,\" he said. Though Mr Lanzone added that Ask Jeeves would be helping organise the database of 300m blog entries Bloglines holds with its own net indexing technology. \"Being able to search the blogosphere as one corpus of information will be very useful in its own right,\" said Mr Lanzone. Rumours about the acquisition were broken by the Napsterization weblog which said it got the hint from Ask Jeeves insiders.\n",

      "Toxic web links help virus spread\n",
      "\n",
      "Virus writers have begun using the power of the web to spread their malicious wares.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Windows virus called Bofra is turning infected machines into distributors of its malicious code. Those clicking on the poisoned links in e-mail messages sent out by infected machines may fall victim to the virus. The trick is being used to prevent the progam being caught by anti-virus software that combs through code contained in e-mail attachments.\n",
      "\n",
      "The virus that uses this trick is called Bofra and the first member of the family of worms appeared on 10 November. They exploit a Windows vulnerability that was discovered only a few days earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like many other recent viruses, Bofra plunders the address book in Microsoft Outlook for e-mail addresses and scours other files on an infected machine for fresh target addresses. The virus uses its own mail sending software to despatch e-mail messages to potential victims but, unlike many other recent viruses, does not itself travel via mail. Instead the body of the mail messages sent out contain fake weblinks that, when clicked on, connect back to the machine that distributed that e-mail. Essentially, Bofra turns infected machines into small web servers that happily dole out copies of the virus. The messages try to trick people into clicking on the links by promising pornographic videos and images or by posing as payment confirmation for a Paypal transaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Copies of the messages seen by the BBC News website had bright yellow and green backgrounds. Those clicking on the links will inadvertently download the Bofra virus which will then start searching for new addresses to send itself to. Filtering firm Clearswift said this tactic of creating thousands of mini web servers was designed to help the virus spread quickly and avoid attempts to shut it down. In the past other malicious programs have relied on a single web server that downloads viral code to target machines. Shutting down this central server usually stops the virus spreading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearswift said that fact that no viral code travels in the e-mail messages sent out by machines infected by Bofra could hamper effects to limit its spread. Finnish anti-virus firm F-Secure said that, so far, it had not seen many copies of the Bofra virus and its variants in circulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tim Warner, spokesman for anti-virus firm Finjan, said: \"You have people getting very creative now to deliver the virus and get it propagating.\" Mr Warner said organisations needed to prepare deep defences to keep out the modern form of malicious mobile code. \"Most firms have secured their e-mail gateway,\" said Mr Warner, \"but the irony is that most of them let malicious content through the web gateways.\" He said behavioural systems that monitor what users do can help to spot when viruses have penetrated organisations and have started hunting for other victims. The Bofra family of viruses, which were originally thought to be offshoots of the MyDoom bug, can infect machines running Windows 2000, 95, 98, Me, NT, XP and Server 2003. Users running Windows XP that have applied the SP2 update are not vulnerable to the loophole that Bofra exploits.\n",

      "\n",
      "Viruses, trojans and other malicious programs sent on to the net to catch you out are undergoing a subtle change.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shift is happening as tech savvy criminals turn to technology to help them con people out of cash, steal valuable data or take over home PCs. Viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are getting rarer. Instead programs are now crafted for directly criminal ends and firms are tightening up networks with defences to combat the new wave of malicious code.\n",
      "\n",
      "The growing criminal use of malware has meant the end of the neat categorisation of different sorts of viruses and malicious programs. Before now it has been broadly possible to name and categorise viruses by the method they use to spread and how they infect machines. But many of the viruses written by criminals roll lots of technical tricks together into one nasty package.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You cannot put them in to the neat little box that you used to,\" said Pete Simpson, head of the threat laboratory at security firm Clearswift. Now viruses are just as likely to spread by themselves like worms, or to exploit loopholes in browsers or hide in e-mail message attachments. \"It's about outright criminality now,\" said Mr Simpson, explaining why this change has come about. He said many of the criminal programs came from Eastern Europe where cash-rich organised gangs can find a ready supply of technical experts that will crank out code to order. Former virus writer Marek Strihavka, aka Benny from the 29A virus writing group, recently quit the malware scene partly because it was being taken over by spyware writers, phishing gangs, and spammers who are more interested in money rather than the technology. No longer do virus writers produce programs to show off their technical prowess to rivals in the underground world of malware authors. Not least, said Paul King, principal security consultant at Cisco, because the defences against such attacks are so common. \"In many ways the least likely way to do it is e-mail because most of us have got anti-virus and firewalls now,\" he said. Few of the malicious programs written by hi-tech thieves are cleverly written, many are much more pragmatic and use tried and tested techniques to infect machines or to trick users into installing a program or handing over important data. \"If you think of criminals they do not do clever,\" said Mr King, \"they just do what works.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As the tactics used by malicious programs change, said Mr King, so many firms were changing the way they defend themselves. Now many scan machines that connect to the corporate networks to ensure they have not been compromised while off the core network.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many will not let a machine connect and a worker get on with their job before the latest patches and settings have been uploaded. As well as using different tactics, criminals also use technology for reasons that are much more transparent. \"The main motivation now is money,\" said Gary Stowell, spokesman for St Bernard software. Mr Stowell said organised crime gangs were turning to computer crime because the risks of being caught were low and the rates of return were very high. With almost any phishing or spyware attack, criminals are guaranteed to catch some people out and have the contacts to exploit what they recover. So-called spyware was proving very popular with criminals because it allowed them to take over machines for their own ends, to steal key data from users or to hijack web browsing sessions to point people at particular sites. In some cases spyware was being written that searched for rival malicious programs on PCs it infects and then trying to erase them so it has sole ownership of that machine.\n",

      "\n",
      "Owners of some Nokia smartphones are being warned to watch out for malicious wallpaper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those downloading the software could find all the icons on their 7610 phone swapped for images of skulls. When installed the malicious program also locks many of the 7610's functions making it hard to use and harder to repair. The program is only the latest in a series of viruses produced to attack mobile phones.\n",
      "\n",
      "The file, nicknamed Skulls, is thought to have surfaced on shareware sites where people can pick up free add-ons, such as wallpaper, games and ringtones, for their phones Symbian said that it was not sure if the damage Skulls does was intentional or simply a result of bad programming. Soon after being discovered the file is thought to have been removed from the sites that were unwittingly harbouring it. The program is masquerading as software that creates new background images and themes for the main screen of the 7610 phone. The Skulls program is labelled as a file called: 7610.extended.theme.manager.zip.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once installed the program replaces all the icons on the main page with skulls and replaces all the working applications, such as contacts, calendar, notebook etc with non-working versions so the phone becomes almost useless. The only thing the phone can do is make and take calls. A statement by Symbian played down the significance of the malicious program and said few people would fall victim to it as users have to go through several steps to install it, one of which includes ignoring a security warning. Symbian said that the spread of the Skulls program was likely to be limited as the program cannot travel from one phone to another by itself. Despite this Finnish anti-virus lab F-Secure said it had sporadic reports of 7610 owners being caught out by it. The firm has produced guidance for users caught out to help them remove the program and get their phone working again. The Skulls program is thought to have been written by a malicious hacker using the alias Tee-222. Symbian phones produced by Sony Ericsson, Motorola, BenQ, Arima and Fujitsu are unaffected by the Skulls program.\n",

      "\n",
      "Public trust in taxes is breaking down because Labour and Tories are not being straight with people on the issue, Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy has said.\n",
      "\n",
      "A day ahead of the government's pre-Budget report, Mr Kennedy used a speech to say his party was facing up to \"painful economic realities\". He said the current level of taxation was about right, although he would put a new 50% tax on top earners. Other parties have accused the Lib Dems of making uncosted promises. Mr Kennedy made it clear he was determined to counter that accusation. The Lib Dems have already published what they say are the full costings for all their plans and Wednesday's speech did not announce new policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking at the Commonwealth Club, Mr Kennedy said it was critical for a political party to have economic credibility, both on what it promised and what it was expected to deliver. He said. \"Budgets have to add up. Tough choices are needed in public spending.\" The Lib Dems would cut \"low priority\" spending, including the government's ID cards scheme and the Child Trust Fund.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those cutbacks would free up funds for increasing basic state pensions for over-75s, putting more police on the streets and reintroducing fee eye and dental checks, he said. The Lib Dems argue they were honest about taxes in the past by calling for a 1p rise on income tax. Now they say the only simple tax rise they want is a new 50% tax band for top earners to pay for scrapping university tuition fees, providing free personal care for elderly and disabled people and keeping local taxes down. There would also be a local income tax to replace council tax and a number of changes to environmental taxes to ensure it is the \"polluter who pays\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lib Dems say the Tories have only laid out possible options for cutting taxes to grab headlines while Labour has hidden most of its tax rises. Mr Kennedy said: \"That contract with the people - that the government will only tax fairly and will spend their money wisely - can only be sustained if the political parties are straightforward about their plans. \"With the stealth tax strategy of Gordon Brown, the obvious unfairness of our current tax system - especially the council tax, and the empty promises of the Conservative party on this issue - it is no wonder that trust in taxation is breaking down.\" He challenged the Treasury to open up its books so the National Audit Office can report on the government's performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conservative co-chairman Liam Fox said: Liam Fox said \"If Charles Kennedy is serious about making his budgets add up he should start by explaining how they would fund their 100 spending commitments. \"The reality is, the Lib Dems lack the courage to tackle waste and bureaucracy, and the only people who would face 'tough choices' would be the families who would be £630 worse off a year. \" And Chancellor Gordon Brown said the Lib Dem figures did not add up.

      "\n",
      "The chancellor said the vote - expected to fall on 5 May - will give a \"clear and fundamental\" choice between Labour investment and Conservative cuts. Speaking at Labour's spring conference in Gateshead, Mr Brown claimed the NHS was not safe in Conservative hands. He said Tory plans to cut £35bn tax would \"cut deep into public service\".\n",
      "\n",
      "To a packed audience at Gateshead's Sage Centre, the chancellor said the cuts proposed by shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin were the equivalent of sacking every teacher, GP and nurse in the country, he told activists. Laying into the Conservative's record in government he said: \"I give you this promise - with Labour, Britain will never return to the mistakes of ERM and 10% inflation, 15% interest rates, £3bn in lost reserves, 250,000 repossessed, one million in negative equity and three million unemployed. \"Never again Tory boom and bust.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This will be the central dividing line at the election, between a Conservative Party taking Britain back and planning deep cuts of £35bn in our services, and a Labour government taking Britain forward, which on a platform of stability will reform and renew our hospitals, schools and public services and, I am proud to say, spend by 2008 £60bn more.\" Turning to the economy, the chancellor pledged to continue economic stability and growth in a third term in power.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said after seven years Labour had transformed from a party not trusted with the economy to \"the only party trusted with the economy\". It was now a \"party not just of employees, but of employers and managers\", he said. In the speech - which prompted a standing ovation from an audience clearly \"warm\" to Mr Brown - he also promised to end teenage unemployment within the next five years. He also highlighted plans for 100% debt relief for the world's poorest countries, a national minimum wage for 16 and 17-year-olds and the creation of a network of children's centres and flexibility in maternity leave.

      "The prime minister is trying to draw a line under speculation over the state of his relationship with Gordon Brown with the speech in Chatham, Kent. He is saying that prosperity means both individual wealth and ensuring \"radically improved\" public services. He is also claiming Labour is more ideologically united than ever. Mr Brown is currently touring Africa after a week of facing questions about reports of his splits with Downing Street.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the election widely predicted for May, angry Labour MPs this week warned Mr Blair and Mr Brown about the dangers of disunity.

Labour made low inflation, unemployment and mortgage rates the centrepiece of a new poster campaign this week.\n",

The book claims the premier went back on his pledge after support from Cabinet allies and suspicion that Mr Brown was manoeuvring against him. Mr Peston's book claimed that Mr Brown told Mr Blair: \"There is nothing you could ever say to me now that I could ever believe.\" On Wednesday Mr Blair directly denied Mr Brown made that quote, and before he left for Africa on Tuesday the chancellor told reporters: \"Of course I trust the prime minister.\"\n",

      "Tory leader Michael Howard says his party can save £35bn in government spending by tackling waste.\n",
      "\n",
      "The money would be ploughed back into frontline services like the NHS and schools with the rest used to cut government borrowing and reduce taxes. The Tory leader has also shrugged off the defection of one of his MPs, Robert Jackson, a former minister, to Labour. Mr Howard said that these things happened in politics and it would not affect the outcome of the election. \"Let's be realistic - the election is not going to be decided on the basis of what Mr Jackson did\", he told BBC 1's Breakfast with Frost programme. However the defection on Saturday has cast a shadow over the launch of the Conservatives' spending plans. Fuller details are due to be unveiled on Monday.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bulk of the £35bn saved by tackling bureaucracy and inefficient systems will go back into frontline services, Mr Howard said. The £12bn left over would then be spent on reducing government borrowing, he added. However, the remainder would deal with some of the \"unfair taxes\". \"Almost every independent expert says if you get another Labour government you are going to have to pay higher taxes,\" Mr Howard insisted. \"Because borrowing is going up, it is out of control, that is bound to lead to higher taxes or higher interest rates or both. \"So part of the £12bn we are going to apply to filling the government's black hole, reducing the borrowing. \"The rest will be used to reduce these unfair taxes which are bearing so heavily on the people of our country today.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Howard is expected to say that around £6bn will be available for tax cuts when he makes his announcement on Monday. The cuts will be paid for out of the savings identified by business trouble-shooter David James. Home Office spending could be cut by £1.6bn, according to the final instalment of his year-long review. Savings of £153m at the Foreign Office and £336m at the Department for Culture Media and Sport, have also been identified. In all, almost a quarter of a million jobs and 168 public bodies would go under Mr James' proposals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Howard said: \"All this adds up to a bottom line and the bottom line is at this election people will have a clear choice between Mr Blair, who will waste more and tax more, and a Conservative government that will give them value for money and tax less.\" However, Chief Treasury Secretary Paul Boateng said: \"None of the Tories' figures add up so they can't make these savings and can't pay for any tax cuts, which means the only guaranteed cut from the Tories is £35bn of cuts, hitting frontline public services hard.\" Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy added: \"People will not be taken in by Michael Howard's claims of £35bn worth of savings. \"This can't be achieved without drastic cuts in local services in their own communities.\" A poll for the News of the World newspaper suggests the Conservatives are on course for their worst election defeat in a century. Labour will hold key marginal constituencies, winning a majority of 160, the Populus survey suggests. And the Liberal Democrats will take three key seats from the Conservatives, leaving the Tories with just 163 MPs, two less than they returned atLabour's 1997 landslide and their worst showing since 1906.\n",

      "Chancellor rallies Labour voters\n",
      "\n",
      "Gordon Brown has issued a rallying cry to supporters, warning the \"stakes are too high\" to stay at home or protest vote in the next general election.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chancellor said the poll - expected to fall on 5 May - would give a \"clear and fundamental\" choice between Labour investment and Tory cuts. He told his party's spring conference the Tories must not be allowed to win. The Conservatives and Lib Dems insisted that voters faced higher taxes and means-testing under Labour.\n",
      "\n",
      "To a packed audience at Gateshead's Sage Centre, Mr Brown accused shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin of plotting cuts that were the equivalent of sacking every teacher, GP and nurse in the country. Laying into the Conservative's record in government he said: \"I give you this promise - with Labour, Britain will never return to the mistakes of ERM and 10% inflation, 15% interest rates, £3bn in lost reserves, 250,000 repossessed, one million in negative equity and three million unemployed. \"Never again Tory boom and bust.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This will be the central dividing line at the election, between a Conservative Party taking Britain back and planning deep cuts of £35bn in our services, and a Labour government taking Britain forward, which on a platform of stability will reform and renew our hospitals, schools and public services and, I am proud to say, spend by 2008 £60bn more.\" Turning to the economy, the chancellor promised to continue economic stability and growth in a third term in power.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also pledged to continue the fight against child and pensioner poverty. And he promised help to get young people on the property ladder. \"My message to the thousands of young couples waiting to obtain their first home is that housing is rightly now at the centre of our coming manifesto,\" he said. \"And the next Labour government will match our low mortgage rates with a new first-time buyers' initiative.\" In the speech, which prompted a standing ovation, he also promised to end teenage unemployment within the next five years.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also highlighted plans for 100% debt relief for the world's poorest countries, a national minimum wage for 16 and 17-year-olds, the creation of a network of children's centres and flexibility in maternity leave. Responding to the speech, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, George Osborne, said: \"This was more talk from Gordon Brown. \"We've heard it all before. Instead of talking about the future he kept on talking about the past. \"He completely failed to say which taxes he would put up to fill the black hole in his spending plans. \"There will be a simple choice at the election - value for money and lower taxes with the Conservatives, or more waste and higher taxes under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Liberal Democrat shadow chancellor Vince Cable warned the picture was not as rosy as Mr Brown would like to portray it. \"For all his trumpeting of Labour's management of the economy, Gordon Brown's record is very mixed,\" he said. \"Gordon Brown has created a system of massive centralisation and bureaucracy, a system which subjects millions of people to means testing, and a system of taxation which is extremely complex. \"For all his positive words, Gordon Brown is faced with economic problems looming on the horizon, not least the unprecedented levels of personal debt facing the nation.\" Also in Gateshead, the prime minister took questions sent in by e-mail, text message and telephone as part of Labour's attempt to engage the public in their campaign. Mr Blair told the audience he believed the Iraq war would have made Britain a safer place if its emerging democracy succeeded and that he wanted to bring troops home as soon as possible, but not before the job was done. He also said he wanted to carry on as PM \"because I still think that there are big changes our country needs\".\n",

      "\n",
      "Wales record cap holder Gareth Llewellyn will retire from Test rugby at the end of the Six Nations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The veteran lock, who is 36 at the end of February, told BBC Wales Scrum V that it is time for him to bring down the curtain on his 92-cap Wales career. Llewellyn is on a one-season deal with French club side Narbonne, but said he may consider retiring from all rugby. \"I don't know what I'll do next year, whether to carry on playing or make a change in my career,\" Llewellyn said. \"Narbonne are really keen for me to stay on for next year, so I've got to decide whether to stay on there or maybe go somewhere else, but ultimitely coaching is where I'd like to end up. \"I've done all the coaching awards and everything you can do in that respect, so it's just hopefully getting a chance somewhere.\" Fellow locks Robert Sidoli and Brent Cockbain, who both scored tries in Saturday's Six Nations win in Italy, are Wales coach Mike Ruddock's preferred starters in the second row.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the resurgence of the Dragons' Ian Gough and the adaptibility of lock-cum-flanker Jon Thomas on the bench, Llewellyn has not yet made a match-day squad this Six Nations campaign. But the former Neath and Ospreys player is still targetting one last outing in the red shirt. \"If I do get on the field then brilliant, although the boys are doing really well and I'm very pleased for them,\" Llewellyn added. \"We've had some really tough years in Wales and the players have been through a hell of a lot. \"Sometimes the easiest thing would have been to throw the towel in and walk away, but a few of us dug in there and it's really nice to see some of the boys getting the rewards now. \"I was going to retire at the end of the last Six Nations, I'd even told some of the boys in the squad about it. \"But Mike (Ruddock) asked me to carry on for another season, which I've done, still part of the squad, still trying to help them out as much as I can.\" Llewellyn made his Wales debut in 1989 against New Zealand as a 20-year-old, having caught the selectors' eyes in the All Blacks' tour match against Neath. The 6ft 6in player has not looked back since, going on to break Neil Jenkins' Wales cap record on 12 June 2004 in the 50-44 loss in Argentina.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's been lots of highs - winning the Six Nations in '94, beating England in '93, I've been on some great tours and seen some fantastic countries,\" Llewellyn said. \"But I think the best thing of all for me was the time I spent with the players, I've met some great guys in rugby and made some great friends. \"It'll be a bit strange on international days having to find somewhere to watch Wales play, but at least I might have time to get my golf handicap down!\" Llewellyn captained Neath for seven seasons, while being an integral part of the Neath-Swansea Ospreys regional side's first season. But with the Ospreys building for the future, Llewellyn was eventually forced to look to France for employment - digging in his heels during contract negotiations to insist he must be allowed to play for Wales.\n",

      "Lewis Moody has flown to Dublin to join England's camp ahead of their RBS Six Nations game against Ireland on Sunday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite joining the squad, the Leicester flanker only has a \"slim\" chance of playing because of an infection in his finger. A decision will be taken on Saturday as to whether the 26-year-old will be declared fit. If he fails to recover in time for the game, his place at the back of the pack will be taken by Andy Hazell. Chris Jones will then start the game on the bench. \"The chances of him playing are very slim,\" said coach Andy Robinson. \"The infection is deeper than was thought.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Moody had to be put on a drip in an attempt to force antibiotics through his infected finger. He suffered the cut playing against France at Twickenham and it became infected during a 10-minute outing as a replacement for Leicester against Newcastle last Saturday. \"The mud got into it,\" Robinson added. \"He has had a big course of antibiotics but they haven't done the job we hoped they would.\" Robinson has already been forced to make one change to the starting line-up with Bath prop Matt Stevens coming in for the injured Phil Vickery.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 22-year-old has only made 10 starts for his club but has made 49 appearances from the bench. \"It can be frustrating but I've had a lot more game time this season and I'm ready for it,\" Stevens said. \"I've been on tour with these boys and I've been in the England set-up for two years so I know the calls and the way they play.\" Stevens will be winning his third cap on Sunday after coming on twice as a replacement on the tour to New Zealand last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Robinson has confirmed that fly-half Charlie Hodgson will be the first-choice kicker despite his three missed penalties and a drop goal against France. \"Charlie's state of mind is very good,\" said Robinson. \"Obviously, we are all disappointed we lost the French game and the circumstances in which we did. \"But he responded well last week in his goalkicking for Sale and he will be our first-choice kicker this week.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Robinson also admits his side must improve their line-out work against Irish duo Malcolm O'Kelly and Paul O'Connell, one of the most effective partnerships in the game. \"In each game we've missed a number of line-outs,\" he added. \"It cost us the game against Wales but it has improved. \"It was better against France and will have to go up another notch against Ireland. It will be a huge battle. \"Look at the way they tore us apart last year. If it doesn't function, we will be in for a torrid time.\"\n",

      "Duff sustained a knee injury in the FA Cup defeat at Newcastle and manager Jose Mourinho said: \"He cannot run. His injury is very painful, so he is out.\" But Mourinho has revealed defender Willian Gallas and striker Didier Drogba will be in the starting line-up. The Blues boss took the unusual step of naming his side a day before the match, with Jole Cole named in midfield. Mourinho said: \"We have one more session but I think Drogba will play, and Gallas will play. \"Drogba trained on Monday with no problems and will do the same on Tuesday. Gallas feels he can play and wants to play. We are protecting him still but he will be okay to play.\" Drogba, Chelsea's £24m striker, has missed the last three weeks through injury.\n",

      "\n",
      "Chelsea left-back Wayne Bridge could miss the rest of the season with a suspected broken ankle.\n",
      "\n",
      "The England international, 24, was hurt in an innocuous challenge with Alan Shearer during the Londoners' FA Cup defeat at Newcastle on Sunday. \"We think it's a big injury,\" said Jose Mourinho, whose Chelsea team this week meet Barcelona in the Champions League and Liverpool in the Carling Cup final. William Gallas and Damien Duff could also miss the Barcelona game. France defender Gallas and Ireland winger Duff both picked up their injuries in the closing stages of Chelsea's 1-0 defeat at St James' Park.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Bridge having gone off after Mourinho used all three substitutes, those knocks plus Carlo Cudicini's red card meant Chelsea finished the game with seven able-bodied players. Cudicini would not have played against Barcelona, but had been promised a game in the Carling Cup final, although he will now miss the Cardiff showpiece through suspension. The manager is not planning to add any new names to his squad ahead of the trip to Barcelona, even though he has few options to replace Bridge at left-back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Celestine Babayaro left the club in January, ironically to join Newcastle, and although Gallas has deputised at left-back before, he is struggling to be fit himself. It could be that Paulo Ferreira, usually a right-back, is switched to left-back with Glen Johnson, who ended the Newcastle game in goal, playing on the right. Youngsters Ben Hudell, Joe Keenan and Sam Tillen would be options should Mourinho decide to call up a replacement, but it is unlikely he would risk an untried prospect in a Champions League tie. Bridge's injury also means Mourinho, who reportedly wants to sign Ashley Cole from Arsenal, will not have a specialist, senior left-back for the run-in to the season.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He (Bridge) has no chance of playing against Barcelona, probably will not play against Liverpool (in the Carling Cup final) and maybe not for the rest of the season,\" he said. \"The medical department will try to do everything to recover Gallas and Duff. We will have to wait and see, but I won't cry about injuries because we will have 11 players to play on Tuesday.\" Shearer said he was unsure what caused Bridge's injury. \"I don't know what happened.\" he said. \"It was just a shame. I don't think we even touched each other. \"By all accounts it's pretty serious. I went into the dressing-room after the game and wished him all the best.\" Mourinho, whose team are chasing three trophies, has already lost winger Arjen Robben to a serious injury.\n",

      "\n",
      "Wales number eight Michael Owen says replacing Gareth Thomas as Wales' captain will be straightforward because of the leadership quality in the squad.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You dream about playing for Wales, but it never enters your head that you will one day captain your country,\" he said. \"It's an easy job really because there are so many experienced players in the side, but it will be a massive honour.\" Coach Mike Ruddock says the 24-year-old should take the armband from broken thumb victim Thomas against Scotland. Ruddock praised Owen's contribution as vice-captain and pack leader in this year's wins over England, Italy and France, notably his role in the second-half in Paris following Thomas' injury. The 22-cap Dragons man says that Thomas will be badly missed, though. \"Gareth is going to be a massive loss because he is a brilliant player and he has done a fantastic job since he has been captain,\" said Owen. \"He has put his own unique stamp on things. We are going to miss him but the strength of the squad is shown when you have someone like Kevin Morgan to step in.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Owen admitted the Grand Slam had been mentioned within the squad but that no-one was getting carried away with the three victories over England, Italy and France. \"We can't get ahead of ourselves,\" he said. \"We have a massive game next up and we are just looking forward to preparing for that. \"Scotland are improving all the time. Like us they did well in France and were unlucky not to get a win. \"Against Ireland they played fantastically well in the first 15 minutes before falling away. \"They are probably going on a similar journey to the one we have been on in the last couple of years.\"\n",

The event is split into two groups of four with the top two from each advancing to the semi-finals.\n",

      "Mauresmo's win was her ninth in a row as she tries to overtake Lindsay Davenport for the number one spot. Mauresmo spent five weeks at number one after the US Open before injury ushered Davenport back in front. \"Since then, I feel very confident on court and my game is there. I want to get the ranking back, but it's very different than before I was number one. \"It was an obsession, but now I take it in a relaxed way.\" Mauresmo completed her first match in the season-ending championship in 54 minutes as Russia's Zvonareva struggled to return her serve and failed to achieve a single break point.\n",

Maybe that is why I couldn't do 100%. But I was fighting.\" Sharapova, who lost 6-2 6-2 to Kuznetsova in Beijing in September, said: \"In Beijing, she was coming off such a big winning streak [14 matches] and she was unstoppable. \"This time, it was important to start off well and put some pressure on her.\" The tournament debutant added: \"I love it here. The atmosphere is great. \"To be here where the Lakers play, you just feel that excitement. I love basketball.\" Williams admitted she is still some way off her best form but remained positive after two wins in two days. \"It's hard to go out there and get it right but I'm fighting and I'm hoping,\" said Williams. \"What makes me happy is the effort.

      "\"I have to be positive, I still have a few weeks,\" she said. \"My body has to get accustomed again to the stress, the rhythm.\" Henin-Hardenne slid down the world rankings in the second half of 2004 after contracting the illness in April. After an initial lay-off, she was forced off the circuit for a second time after being knocked out of the French Open in the second round. A comeback at the US Open after a three-month absence ended when she crashed out at the fourth-round stage. But despite her problems, she still won five of the nine official tournaments she entered in 2004 and won Olympic gold in Athens, an achievement which saw her named Belgian sportswoman of the year on Friday. \"Physically, it's obvious that I hit rock bottom,\" said the 22-year-old, who will make her comeback in the Sydney International from 10-16 January. \"Since April, with the exception of the Olympics, I have not done much. \"All the successes I had prior to that were mainly due to the work I put in on building up my fitness. \"Now it's time to get back to putting in 200% effort and I think I am capable of doing that.\"\n",

In a see-saw second set, Bondarenko raced into a 5-2 lead and though Mirza hauled herself level, the Ukrainian broke again before finally levelling the match. Mirza rediscovered the aggressive strokes that took her to the first set in the decider established a 5-2 lead. At 5-3, the stadium erupted in celebration when Mirza thought she had delivered an ace to secure victory but the serve was ruled to have clipped the net.

Eton Corporation's Porsche designed P7131 digital radio set will be launched both as a DAB radio in the UK as well as a satellite radio set in the US. DAB sets have been slow to take-off in the UK, but this one concentrates on sleek looks as much as technology. \"It is for the risqu&#233; consumer,\" said an Eton spokesperson. \"We are proud of it because it has the sound quality for the audiophile and the looks for the design-conscious consumer.\" The Porsche radio is set to go on sale at the end of January in the US and in the first quarter of 2005 in the UK. In the US is it expected to cost $250 (£133). \n",

      "The average person has a library of 600 digital images estimates the Consumer Electronics Association, the organisation behind CES. This is expected to grow to a massive 3,420 images - or 7.2GB - in five years' time. One gadget that might help swell that collection is Sanyo's tiny handheld VPC-C4 camcorder which is another innovation in design and engineering award winner. It combines high quality video and stills in a very small device. It takes MPEG4 video quality at 30 frames a second and has a four megapixel still camera. Images and video are stored on SD cards, which have come down in price in recent months. A 512MB card will store about 30 minutes of video and 420 stills. The device is so tiny it can be controlled with one thumb. Because images and video are stored on SD memory, it is portable to other devices and means other data like audio can be stored on the card too. \n",

      "\n",
      "\"Welcome to CeBit 2005\" was the message from the pilot as we landed, the message on flyers at the airport, and the message on just about every billboard in town. CeBit fever has taken over Hanover. Hotels have been booked out for months; local people are letting out rooms in their homes to the hoards of exhibitors, visitors, and journalists. CeBit itself is huge, the exhibition site could almost be classified as a town in its own right.\n",

      "There are restaurants, shops, and a bus service between the halls - of which there are 27. There are more than 6,000 companies here, showing their latest products. The list of them that I was given when I came in is the size and weight of a phone book. One of the mains themes this year is the digital home, and one of the key buzzwords is convergence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"entertainment PC\" is being billed as the replacement for DVD players, stereos, telephones and computers - offering a one-box solution, wirelessly connected throughout a house. To show them off, one display has been modelled as a prototype \"digital lifestyle home\" by German magazine Computer Reseller News. \"We wanted to show how this fits into a living room or workplace, to give people a feeling how it would work in their homes,\" said Claudia Neulling from the magazine. The house has webcams for security in each room, which can be called up on the high definition TV, connected to the PC in the living room.\n",
      "\n",
      "That PC provides home entertainment, movies or music. It can also be linked to the car parked outside, which is kitted out with a processor of its own, along with a DVD player and cordless headphones for the kids in the back. \"Convergence for me is about how technology, the transfer of data, can do things that make it easier and more convenient for me as a consumer,\" said Mark Brailey, director of corporate marketing for Intel. \"The real challenge is to show people it's easier than they think, and fun.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He firmly believes that entertainment PCs are the future, but says they have to get past people's fears of frequent crashes and incompatibilities. That is something Microsoft is trying to do too - its stand has computers running Windows XP Media Centre edition 2005 for people to try out. Mobile phones do not escape the convergence theme. Samsung is showing off its SGH-i300, a handset with a three gigabyte hard drive, that can be used to watch compressed video or as an MP3 player. And if you would rather watch live TV than a downloaded movie NEC is showing a phone, on sale in China, which can show analogue TV on its colour screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think the most probable application is at somewhere like the train station - if you want to check the status of the soccer game for example\" said Koji Umemoto, manager of mobile terminals marketing for NEC. He admitted that the signal quality is not very good if you are on the move, and they do not have plans to launch it in Europe at the moment. Nokia was happy to demonstrate its 6230i, an upgrade to the very popular 6230.\n",
      "\n",
      "It now has a 1.3 megapixel camera, and a music player that can handle multiple formats, rather than just MP3s. It is also compatible with Nokia's new Visual Radio technology. The handset can receive FM broadcasts, and the user can interact with compatible broadcasts using a GPRS connection, to take part in competitions or get extra information such as the name of the song playing. Most companies are reluctant to show prototypes, preferring to display products that are already on sale, or just about to hit the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Portable media player firm Creative showed off a new wireless technology, based on magnetic inductance rather than radio - a system some hearing aids use. \"The benefits over conventional Bluetooth are the lack of interference, and longer battery life,\" said Riccardo de Rinaldini, Creative's European marketing manager. The firm has a prototype headset linked up to a Zen Micro player. The transmitter on the player creates a private, magnetic \"bubble\" around the user, which is picked up by the headset. The range is only about one metre so it is only suitable for personal use. A single AAA battery is said to last up to 30 hours. Creative expects it to hit the market in its final form later this year. Even clothing is likely to be part of the convergence trend. Adidas has a trainer which, according to Susanne Risse from the company, can \"sense, understand, and adapt to your running style\". It has a battery, processor, and motor embedded in the sole. Buttons on the side allow you to set the amount of cushioning you would like by adjusting the tension on a cable running through the heel. The processor then monitors the surface you are running on, and adjusts the tension accordingly. It is being billed as \"the world's first intelligent shoe\".\n",

      "Gamers could drive high-definition\n",
      "\n",
      "TV, films, and games have been gearing up for some time now for the next revolution to transform the quality of what is on our screens.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is called high-definition - HD for short - and it is already hugely popular in Japan and the US. It is set, according to analysts, to do for images what CDs did for sound. Different equipment able to receive HD signals is needed though and is expensive. But Europe's gamers may be the early adopters to drive demand. Europeans will have to wait until at least 2006 until they see mainstream HDTV.\n",
      "\n",
      "To view it, it needs to be transmitted in HD format, and people need special receivers and displays that can handle the high-quality resolution. The next generation of consoles, however, are expected to start appearing at the end of 2005, start of 2006. And most new computer displays and plasma sets are already capable of handling such high-resolution pictures. \"In the next generation [of consoles] HD support is mandatory,\" Dr Mark Tuffy games systems director at digital content firm THX told the BBC News website. \"Every game is going to be playable in HD. \"So consumers who have gone out and spent all this money on HDTVs, and who have no content to watch, are going to be blown away by these really high-detail pictures. \"It's going to change really the way they look at gaming.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of last year, Chris Deering, Sony's European president, made a prediction that 20 million European households would have HDTV sets by 2008. A previous prediction from analysts Datamonitor put the figure at 4.6 million by 2008, an increase from an estimated 50,000 sets at the end of 2003. But those in Europe may see little point in buying what is quite an expensive bit of technology - about £2,000 - if there are few programmes or films to watch on them. Satellite broadcaster BSkyB is planning HDTV services in 2006 and the BBC intends to produce all of its content in HD by 2010.\n",
      "\n",
      "Until broadcast rights, format standards - and the practicalities of updating equipment - are agreed, TV content will be limited. All TV images are made up of pixels which go across the screen, and scan lines which go down the screen. Most standard UK TV pictures are made up of 625 lines and about 700 pixels. HD offers up to 1,080 active lines, with each line made up of 1,920 pixels. This means the picture is up to six times as sharp as standard TV. \"Probably, in the UK [gaming] is going to be the only thing you are going to really be able to show off, as in 'look what this TV can do', until HD is really adopted by broadcasters,\" explains Dr Tuffy. But gamers are also the ideal target audience for HD because they always crave better quality graphics, and more immersive gaming experiences. They are used to spending money on hardware to match a game's requirements. Demographics have changed too and the \"sweet spot\" for the games industry is the gamer in his or her late 20s. This means they are likely to have higher disposable incomes and can afford the price of big-screen, high-definition display technologies and HD projectors, earlier than others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Higher capacity storage discs, such as HD-DVD and blue-ray , are set to be standard in the next round of games consoles - allowing developers more room for detailed graphics.\n",
      "\n",
      "For console developers though, HD offers some production changes. It could make games production slightly more expensive, thinks Dr Tuffy. \"But we may see the cross-platform development of games becoming more common because they will more easily be able to take a PC game and apply it to a console,\" he says. \"You are literally going to get to the point, with a Lord of the Rings game for example, is going to be closer and closer to the actual film, especially the CGI stuff from the DVD. \"And the transition when they move from a cut scene to the game, just now they have almost got it seamless.\" With HD, he says, the transition will be completely seamless and the same quality as the big-screen cinema release. This could herald an increasing convergence between the film and gaming industry. But it may not be until the generation after the next games consoles where the two industries really collide. At that point, says Dr Tuffy, games could become more or less interactive movies.\n",

      "TV future in the hands of viewers\n",
      "\n",
      "With home theatre systems, plasma high-definition TVs, and digital video recorders moving into the living room, the way people watch TV will be radically different in five years' time.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is according to an expert panel which gathered at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas to discuss how these new technologies will impact one of our favourite pastimes. With the US leading the trend, programmes and other content will be delivered to viewers via home networks, through cable, satellite, telecoms companies, and broadband service providers to front rooms and portable devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most talked-about technologies of CES has been digital and personal video recorders (DVR and PVR). These set-top boxes, like the US's TiVo and the UK's Sky+ system, allow people to record, store, play, pause and forward wind TV programmes when they want.\n",
      "\n",
      "Essentially, the technology allows for much more personalised TV. They are also being built-in to high-definition TV sets, which are big business in Japan and the US, but slower to take off in Europe because of the lack of high-definition programming. Not only can people forward wind through adverts, they can also forget about abiding by network and channel schedules, putting together their own a-la-carte entertainment. But some US networks and cable and satellite companies are worried about what it means for them in terms of advertising revenues as well as \"brand identity\" and viewer loyalty to channels. Although the US leads in this technology at the moment, it is also a concern that is being raised in Europe, particularly with the growing uptake of services like Sky+. \"What happens here today, we will see in nine months to a years' time in the UK,\" Adam Hume, the BBC Broadcast's futurologist told the BBC News website. For the likes of the BBC, there are no issues of lost advertising revenue yet. It is a more pressing issue at the moment for commercial UK broadcasters, but brand loyalty is important for everyone. \"We will be talking more about content brands rather than network brands,\" said Tim Hanlon, from brand communications firm Starcom MediaVest. \"The reality is that with broadband connections, anybody can be the producer of content.\" He added: \"The challenge now is that it is hard to promote a programme with so much choice.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "What this means, said Stacey Jolna, senior vice president of TV Guide TV group, is that the way people find the content they want to watch has to be simplified for TV viewers. It means that networks, in US terms, or channels could take a leaf out of Google's book and be the search engine of the future, instead of the scheduler to help people find what they want to watch. This kind of channel model might work for the younger iPod generation which is used to taking control of their gadgets and what they play on them. But it might not suit everyone, the panel recognised. Older generations are more comfortable with familiar schedules and channel brands because they know what they are getting. They perhaps do not want so much of the choice put into their hands, Mr Hanlon suggested. \"On the other end, you have the kids just out of diapers who are pushing buttons already - everything is possible and available to them,\" said Mr Hanlon. \"Ultimately, the consumer will tell the market they want.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the 50,000 new gadgets and technologies being showcased at CES, many of them are about enhancing the TV-watching experience. High-definition TV sets are everywhere and many new models of LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) TVs have been launched with DVR capability built into them, instead of being external boxes. One such example launched at the show is Humax's 26-inch LCD TV with an 80-hour TiVo DVR and DVD recorder. One of the US's biggest satellite TV companies, DirectTV, has even launched its own branded DVR at the show with 100-hours of recording capability, instant replay, and a search function. The set can pause and rewind TV for up to 90 hours. And Microsoft chief Bill Gates announced in his pre-show keynote speech a partnership with TiVo, called TiVoToGo, which means people can play recorded programmes on Windows PCs and mobile devices. All these reflect the increasing trend of freeing up multimedia so that people can watch what they want, when they want.\n",

      "\n",
      "Music downloading, for those that have rejected the free peer to peer services, can be a costly business.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cost of paying even as little as 70p per track can add up, particularly for those people who own one of the new generation of players that can store thousands of songs. Paying per track for music is becoming as outmoded as paying per minute for internet access and alternative monthly or yearly subscription models are springing up as a more convenient, and ultimately cheaper way of owning music.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Music fans are moving away from buying the traditional bundled package of a dozen or more songs that we used to call an album to newer ways that fit their lifestyle; either single tracks or subscriptions services,\" said Paul Myers, chief executive of Wippit, a UK-based music download service. While iTunes is doing good business with its sales of individual tracks to iPod owners, others are questioning whether the concept of owning music is even valid in the digital age. Napster is due to launch a new rental subscription service - dubbed Napster to Go in the UK in the next few months. The service can be used on players that support Microsoft Windows latest Digital Rights Management technology known as Janus. This includes players made by Samsung, Rio and Creative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently on offer in beta-version in the US, the service costs $15 per month for unlimited downloads. The technology ensures that music downloaded to the player only remains playable while the user subscribes to the service. Users need to update their license on a monthly basis or the tunes will no longer play.\n",
      "\n",
      "This has outraged some digital music lovers, especially as Napster already offers a cheaper service for downloading music to the PC. Napster claims the higher price is a result of record labels charging more for the to-go service and says it also offers \"greater value\" for customers. Mr Myers is not convinced a rental model will work for consumers. \"We've been offering our unlimited music subscription service for more than three years now and our customers know what they want. Format interoperability, excellent value and the reassurance that music purchased from Wippit is theirs to keep and enjoy on whatever device they choose,\" he said. \"Who wants to download a track that won't play next month if you decide to unsubscribe to the service or change portable player for an iPod or the latest mobile phone?\" Wippit offers a download subscription service for £4.99 per month or £50 per year. It has a catalogue of around 60,000 songs.\n",

      "Arsenal through on penalties\n",
      "\n",
      "Arsenal win 4-2 on penalties\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spanish goalkeeper saved from Alan Quinn and Jon Harley as Arsenal sealed a quarter-final trip to Bolton with a 4-2 victory on penalties. Lauren, Patrick Vieira, Freddie Ljungberg and Ashley Cole scored for Arsenal, while Andy Gray and Phil Jagielka were on target for the Blades. Michael Tonge and Harley wasted chances for the underdogs, but Paddy Kenny was inspired to keep Arsenal at bay. Arsenal, stripped of attacking talent such as Thierry Henry and Dennis Bergkamp, partnered 17-year-old Italian striker Arturo Lupoli with Ljungberg up front. It was a revamped Arsenal line-up, and they were almost a goal behind within seconds as Tonge wasted a glorious chance. Gray ran free down the right flank, and his cross left Tonge with the simplest of chances, but he blazed over the top from six yards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arsenal were barely seen as an attacking force in the opening 45 minutes, although Ljungberg turned a half-chance wide after good work by Cesc Fabregas. Arsene Wenger introduced Quincy Owusu-Abeyie for the ineffective Lupoli at half-time, and the pacy Dutch youngster had an immediate impact. He ran clear after good work by Mathieu Flamini, but his finish was tame and Kenny saved easily. Owusu-Abeyie then fired in a testing cross, which was met by Fabregas, and it needed a desperate clearance by Kenny's legs to save the Blades. Arsenal were now totally dominant, and were desperately unlucky not to take the lead after 62 minutes when Fabregas crashed a rising drive against the bar from 20 yards. It then took a brilliant tackle by Jagielka to deny Ljungberg as he was poised to strike. Arsenal continued to press, and once again Kenny was called into action with eight minutes left, diving low to clutch another close-range effort from Fabregas. Neil Warnock's side almost snatched victory in the dying seconds when Derek Geary's cross found Harley at the far post, but his diving header was brilliantly turned over by Almunia. Owusu-Abeyie's pace was causing all sorts of problems for the Blades, and as extra-time began, another surging run into the penalty area almost set up a chance for Ljungberg. Pascal Cygan missed Arsenal's best chance after 106 minutes, blazing across the face of goal when he was unmarked at the far post. Arsenal sent on Jeremie Aliadiere with seven minutes of extra-time left, and he almost broke the deadlock with his first touch. Kolo Toure's misplaced free-kick landed at his feet, but Kenny once again blocked from a tight angle. Arsenal laid siege to Sheffield United's goal in the dying minutes, but they somehow held on to force penalties. Almunia was then Arsenal's hero as another brave Blades cup campaign came to a losing end.\n",

      "Hugo Southwell's try gave the Scots an early 8-0 lead but scores from locks Malcolm O'Kelly and Paul O'Connell put the visitors in command by half-time. A third try from wing Denis Hickie and third penalty from Ronan O'Gara, who kicked 13 points, extended the lead. Jon Petrie scored a second try for Scotland but late scores from John Hayes and Gavin Duffy sealed victory. After two hard-earned away victories, Eddie O'Sullivan' side can now look forward to welcoming England to Lansdowne Road in a fortnight. Scotland will try to give their coach Matt Williams a first Six Nations victory when Italy come to Edinburgh, but they again struggled to turn pressure into points. The home side started with tremendous intensity and dominated territory and possession in the opening 10 minutes. A powerful charge from flanker Jason White was carried on by Ali Hogg and when Ireland conceded a penalty close to their own line, Scotland kicked it to touch. The Irish defence foiled the home side on that occasion, but a stray hand in a ruck allowed Paterson to stroke over a penalty in the eighth minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "If that was a paltry reward for their early pressure, Scotland got the try they deserved when Paterson's searing break and Andy Craig's pass sent Southwell streaking to the right corner. Paterson was off target with the conversion and fly-half Dan Parks then missed a presentable drop-goal attempt. Ireland got themselves on the scoreboard with an O'Gara penalty and by the 24th minute the visitors were ahead. Stuart Grimes pulled down O'Kelly at a line-out, Ireland kicked the penalty to touch and from the set-piece, the big lock was driven over by the rest of his pack.\n",
      "\n",
      "O'Gara added the conversion and a further penalty, after Shane Horgan almost grabbed a second try from O'Gara's chip to the corner, only for the ball to spill from his hand. But Ireland still delivered a hammer blow to Scotland's hopes just before the interval. O'Connell - skipper in the absence of Brian O'Driscoll - powered through Parks' weak tackle after a free-kick from a scrummage to burrow over.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scotland suffered a further blow on the resumption when Ireland flanker Johnny O'Connor won another vital turnover, and O'Gara's basketball pass sent Hickie over in the left corner. O'Gara converted and then thumped over a 40m penalty to give the visitors a commanding 28-8 advantage. Scotland looked bereft of ideas but a half-break from Paterson sparked them back to life just before the hour. Stuart Grimes won a line-out and a well-worked move saw Petrie scuttle round the side of the ruck to dive over in the left corner. But it proved a false dawn, and Ireland reasserted their authority in the final 10 minutes. Peter Stringer and O'Kelly combined to put giant prop Hayes over in the right corner before replacement Gavin Duffy scorched away on the left, David Humphreys adding the final flourish with a touchline conversion.\n",

      "Coach Matt Williams' side were outmuscled and outplayed in a tense first half but led 6-3 at the break. Paterson slotted four more second-half penalties and Scotland were denied a try when wing Sean Lamont's touchdown was ruled out for a forward pass. A late Andrea Masi try was small consolation for Italy, chasing their first away win in the Six Nations. Scotland came out on top of the early exchanges and took a quick 3-0 lead through the boot of full-back Paterson. But the more powerful Azzurri pack eventually rumbled into life.\n",
      "\n",
      "A series of drives into Scottish territory set up a penalty attempt, missed by full-back Roland De Marigny, and a wayward drop-goal effort from Luciano Orquera. Scotland defended the initial thrusts but on 20 minutes Italy, after coming up yards short of the line, equalised through a De Marigny penalty. Italy were offered another penalty when Scottish flanker Simon Taylor was offside but the left-footed De Marigny pushed his kick wide. Scotland finally made the most of a rare foray into the Italian half and snatched three points from Paterson when an Italian forward handled the ball in a ruck.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the half wore on, both sides squandered promising spells of momentum with sloppy penalties, and the period fizzled out with Scotland numerically, if not psychologically, on top. Italy's De Marigny narrowly missed a chance to level the scores again shortly after the break but his long-range kick shaved the right upright. And Scotland capitalised with a third Paterson penalty on 50 minutes. Williams' side seemed to have found a spark from somewhere and, after a couple of probing attacks, Paterson was able to slot another three points to widen the gap.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the pendulum of possession swinging towards Scotland, Lamont thought he had wriggled over in the left corner after 65 minutes but play was recalled for a marginal forward pass from Paterson. Another Paterson penalty on 70 minutes kept the pressure on the wilting visitors. But John Kirwan's men had the last laugh when Gordon Ross' attempted clearance was charged down and Masi pounced for the try, converted by De Marigny.\n",

      "The firm said it hoped to pay $100m now and another $120m over eight years. With assets of $200m and liabilities totalling $648m, it needs creditors' backing for the offer to avoid going into bankruptcy. The trading scandal is the biggest to hit Singapore since the $1.2bn collapse of Barings Bank in 1995. Chen Jiulin, chief executive of China Aviation Oil (CAO), was arrested by at Changi Airport by Singapore police on 8 December. He was returning from China, where he had headed when CAO announced its trading debacle in late-November. The firm had been betting heavily on a fall in the price of oil during October, but prices rose sharply instead.\n",

      "Among the creditors whose backing CAO needs for its restructuring plan are banking giants such as Barclay's Capital and Sumitomo Mitsui, as well as South Korean firm SK Energy. Of the immediate payment, the firm - China's biggest jet fuel supplier - said it would be paying $30m out of its own resources. The rest would come from its parent company, China Aviation Oil Holding Company in Beijing. The holding company, owned by the Chinese government, holds most of CAO's Singapore-listed shares.

Under the agreement, Metlife will be able to sell its products through Citigroup over the next 10 years. The deal includes Smith Barney retail brokerages and Citibank branches. The company will pay between $1bn and $3bn in Metlife stock with the rest being made up of cash. Travelers had sales of $5.2bn in 2004 and made a profit of $901m. It has total net assets of $96bn. \"This deal employs some of Metlife's excess capital in a potentially higher-return business and gives it more distribution,\" said Stuart Quint, an analyst at Gartmore.\n",

      "Pan-European group Euronext is poised to launch a bid for the London Stock Exchange, UK media reports say.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last week, the LSE rejected a takeover proposal from German rival Deutsche Boerse - the 530 pence-a-share offer valued the exchange at about £1.35bn. The LSE, which saw its shares rise 25%, said the bid undervalued the business. Euronext - formed after the Brussels, Paris and Amsterdam exchanges merged - is reportedly working with three investment banks on a possible offer. The LSE, Europe's biggest stock market, is a key prize, listing stocks with a total capitalisation of £1.4 trillion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Euronext already has a presence in London due to its 2001 acquisition of London-based options and futures exchange Liffe. Trades on the LSE are cleared via Clearnet, in which Euronext has a quarter stake.\n",
      "\n",
      "Euronext, which also operates an exchange in Lisbon, last week appointed UBS and ABN Amro as additional advisors. It is also working with Morgan Stanley. Despite the rejection of the Deutsche Boerse bid last week, Werner Seifert, chief executive of the Frankfurt-based exchange, may well come back with an improved offer. It has long wanted to link up with London, and the two tried and failed to seal a merger in 2000. Responding to the LSE's rebuff, Deutsche Boerse - whose market capitalisation is more than £3bn - said it believed it could show its proposal offered benefits, and that it still hoped to make a cash bid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last week the LSE said not only was the bid undervalued, but that it had \"been advised that there can be no assurance that any transaction could be successfully implemented\". However, it has indicated it is open for further talks. Meanwhile, German magazine Der Spiegel said part of Mr Seifert's negotiations with the LSE were about where to base the future board of any merged exchange. While Mr Seifert has suggested a merged company would be run out of London, the mayor of Frankfurt has raised concerns that such a move could cost German jobs. Many analysts believe German Boerse has more financial firepower than Euronext if it came to a bidding war.\n",

      "\n",
      "A shareholder in US phone firm MCI has taken legal action to halt a $6.75bn (£3.6bn) buyout by telecoms giant Verizon, hoping to get a better deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lawsuit was filed on Friday after Qwest Communications, which had an earlier offer for MCI rejected, said it would submit an improved bid. MCI's directors have backed Verizon, despite it tabling less money. They are accused of breaching their fiduciary duties by depriving MCI shareholders \"of maximum value\".\n",
      "\n",
      "According the legal papers filed in a Delaware court, Verizon is set to pay an \"\"unconscionable, unfair and grossly inadequate\" sum for MCI, which was formerly known as Worldcom. Qwest said on Wednesday that MCI had rejected a deal worth $8bn. A number of large MCI shareholders expressed unhappiness at the decision, saying that Verizon's offer, made up of cash, shares and dividends, undervalued the company. Friday's lawsuit argues that the Verizon offer makes no provision for future growth prospects and that consolidation in the US phone industry will put a premium on MCI's network, assets and clients. MCI's directors have argued that Verizon is bigger than Qwest, has fewer debts and has built a successful mobile division. Chief executive Michael Capellas spent last week meeting with shareholders in an effort to win their backing.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2002, investors in the then-named Worldcom lost millions when the company filed for bankruptcy following an accounting scandal. However, the firm - now renamed MCI - has put its operations in order and emerged from bankruptcy protection last April. It is a long-distance and corporate phone firm, and would provide the buyer with access to a global telecommunications network and a large number of business-based subscribers. MCI shares jumped on Friday, hitting their highest level since April 2004 amid speculation that it would be the focus of a bidding war. A takeover of MCI would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since October as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. Earlier this month, SBC Communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone pioneer AT&T for about $16bn.\n",

      "US phone company Qwest has said it will table a new offer for MCI after losing out to larger rival Verizon, setting the scene for a possible bidding war.\n",
      "\n",
      "MCI accepted a $6.75bn (£3.6bn) buyout from telecoms giant Verizon on Monday, rejecting a higher offer from Qwest. Qwest chairman Richard Notebaert sent a letter to MCI's board on Thursday saying that it plans to submit a new offer after examining Verizon's bid. Formerly known as Worldcom, MCI is a long-distance and corporate phone firm. Snapping up MCI would give the buyer access to a global telecommunications network and a large number of business-based subscribers. Shares of MCI were up more than 4% in electronic trading after the close of New York markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Qwest said on Wednesday that MCI had rejected a deal worth $8bn. \"We would like to advise you that once we have completed our review of the Verizon merger agreement, we do intend to submit a modified offer to acquire MCI,\" the letter from Qwest said. Verizon's offer is made up of cash, shares and dividends, and a number of investors have said that it undervalues MCI. Verizon plans to swap 0.41 of its shares and $1.50 in cash for each MCI share, as well as offering special dividends of $4.50 a share. Both company boards have backed the deal, but regulators will still need to give their approval. As well as trying to lure investors with the promise of better returns, Qwest also reckons that its offer will face less regulatory scrutiny than Verizon's.\n",

      "The takeover would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since October as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. Earlier this month, SBC Communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone trailblazer AT&T for about $16bn. There may be concerns other than cash, however, especially as MCI only emerged from bankruptcy protection last April. Verizon is far bigger than Qwest, has fewer debts and has built a successful mobile division. Also, MCI, while trading under the name Worldcom, became the biggest corporate bankruptcy in US history after admitting that it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits. Former Worldcom boss Bernie Ebbers is currently standing trial, accused of overseeing an $11bn fraud. Qwest, meanwhile, had to pay the Securities and Exchange Commission $250m in October to settle charges that it massaged earnings to keep Wall Street happy.\n",

      "Germany's economy shrank 0.2% in the last three months of 2004, upsetting hopes of a sustained recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "The figures confounded hopes of a 0.2% expansion in the fourth quarter in Europe's biggest economy. The Federal Statistics Office said growth for the whole of 2004 was 1.6%, after a year of contraction in 2003, down from an earlier estimate of 1.7%. It said growth in the third quarter had been zero, putting the economy at a standstill from July onward. Germany has been reliant on exports to get its economy back on track, as unemployment of more than five million and impending cuts to welfare mean German consumers have kept their money to themselves. Major companies including Volkswagen, DaimlerChrysler and Siemens have spent much of 2004 in tough talks with unions about trimming jobs and costs. According to the statistics office, Destatis, rising exports were outweighed in the fourth quarter by the continuing weakness of domestic demand.\n",

      "Oil prices have fallen heavily for a second day, closing at three-month lows after news that US crude stocks have improved ahead of winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "London Brent crude closed at $40.15 on Thursday - a drop of 5.1% - having dived below $40 a barrel for the first time since mid-September. US light crude traded in New York lost more than $2 to $43.25, its lowest close since 10 September. The price of both benchmark crudes has dropped 12% in two days. The falls were triggered when the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday that US crude stocks were 3.5% higher than a year ago. The news calmed worries about winter shortages. Weak US fuel and heating oil stocks have been a persistent factor in pushing up oil prices. \"It's amazing how quickly sentiment changed,\" said Rick Mueller, an analyst at Energy Security Analysis. Analysts also attributed the fall to mild early-winter weather, which has tempered demand for heating oil.\n",

      "\n",
      "In London, the FTSE 100 index closed 15 points higher at 4,751. The long-awaited drop in oil prices helped to ease persistent investor jitters over the impact of energy costs on company profits and economic growth. However, traders warned that the fall could be short-lived if there is a cold snap in North America this winter or any major supply problems in other parts of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "The price of crude is still up about 30% on the start of 2004, but has fallen from the record of $55.67 set in late October. Opec nations have increased production to 25-year highs to meet global demand and this has helped rebuild US stocks hit by supply disruptions after Hurricane Ivan in September. Traders were also encouraged by comments on Wednesday from the energy minister of Opec member Algeria. Chakib Khelil said the cartel was likely to keep output unchanged when it meets next week. However, some analysts believe the sharp fall in crude prices may harden Opec's attitude to over-production, leading to a scaling back of oil output.\n",

      "The Reserve Bank of Australia lifted interest rates 0.25% to 5.5%, their first upwards move in more than a year. However, shortly after the Bank made its decision, new figures showed a fall in economic growth in the last quarter. The Bank said it had acted to curb inflation but the move was criticised by some analysts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rate hike was the first since December 2003 and had been well-flagged in advance. However, opposition parties and some analysts said the move was ill-timed given data showing the Australian economy grew just 0.1% between October and December and 1.5% on an annual basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The figures, representing a decline from the 0.2% growth in GDP seen between July and September, were below market expectations. Consumer spending remains strong, however, and the Bank is concerned about growing inflationary pressures. \"Over recent months it has become increasingly clear that remaining spare capacity in the labour and goods markets is becoming rather limited,\" said Ian Macfarlane, Governor of the Reserve Bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "At 2.6%, inflation remains within the Bank's 2-3% target range. However, exports declined in the second half of 2004, fuelling a rise in the country's current account deficit - the difference in the value of imports compared to exports - to a record Australian dollar 29.4bn. The Australian government said the economy remained strong with unemployment at a near 30 year low. \"The economy has been strong and it is properly moderating but it doesn't look to me like it's slowing in any unreasonable way,\" said Treasurer Peter Costello. Stock markets had factored in the likelihood of a rate rise but analysts still expressed concern about the strength of the economy. \"That 1.5% annual growth rate is the lowest we have seen since the post-election slump we saw back in 2000-1,\" said Michael Blythe, chief economist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. \"This suggests the economy really did slow very sharply in the second half of 2004.\"\n",

      "Munich-based research institute Ifo said that its confidence index fell to 95.5 in February from 97.5 in January, its first decline in three months. The study found that the outlook in both the manufacturing and retail sectors had worsened. Observers had been hoping that a more confident business sector would signal that economic activity was picking up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're surprised that the Ifo index has taken such a knock,\" said DZ bank economist Bernd Weidensteiner. \"The main reason is probably that the domestic economy is still weak, particularly in the retail trade.\" Economy and Labour Minister Wolfgang Clement called the dip in February's Ifo confidence figure \"a very mild decline\". He said that despite the retreat, the index remained at a relatively high level and that he expected \"a modest economic upswing\" to continue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Germany's economy grew 1.6% last year after shrinking in 2003. However, the economy contracted by 0.2% during the last three months of 2004, mainly due to the reluctance of consumers to spend. Latest indications are that growth is still proving elusive and Ifo president Hans-Werner Sinn said any improvement in German domestic demand was sluggish. Exports had kept things going during the first half of 2004, but demand for exports was then hit as the value of the euro hit record levels making German products less competitive overseas. On top of that, the unemployment rate has been stuck at close to 10% and manufacturing firms, including DaimlerChrysler, Siemens and Volkswagen, have been negotiating with unions over cost cutting measures. Analysts said that the Ifo figures and Germany's continuing problems may delay an interest rate rise by the European Central Bank.

      "The number of people out of work rose 32,000 to 1.41 million in the last three months of 2004, even as 90,000 more people were in employment. Average earnings rose by 4.3% in the year to December up from November's 4.2%, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) added. Meanwhile, the benefit claimant total fell 11,000 to 813,200 last month. Throughout 2004, the number of people in work increased by 296,000 to 28.52 million - the highest figure since records began in 1971.\n",
      "\n",
      "The apparent discrepancy between rising unemployment and record numbers in work can be explained by an increase in the working population and a fall in those who are economically inactive. While the UK's jobless rate rose to 4.7% from 4.6% in the previous quarter, the rate still remains one of the lowest in the world, compared with 12.1% in Germany, 10.4% in Spain and 9.7% in France. But, despite more people being in work, the manufacturing sector continued to suffer, with 104,000 workers axed during the last quarter of 2004 - pushing employment in the sector to a record low of 3.24 million by the end of last year. The figures prompted some analysts to forecast that the Bank of England will almost certainly raise rates this year. Marc Ostwald, a strategist at Monument Securities told Reuters that while no immediate market impact could be expected, \"it is enough to underline that they (the BoE) will be more hawkish on rates\".\n",

      "Hollywood stars Kevin Spacey and Kate Bosworth attended the British premiere of new film, Beyond the Sea, in London's Leicester Square on Thursday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Spacey, 45, wrote, directed and starred in the film, inspired by the life of 1950s croooner Bobby Darin. \"This is my tribute to someone I think was a remarkable talent,\" said Spacey, who, as Darin, sings all 18 songs on the film soundtrack. Bosworth, 21, plays Darin's wife - real life Hollywood actress Sandra Dee. \"I knew absolutely nothing about Bobby Darin before this film, but now I'm a huge fan,\" said Bosworth, who attended the premiere with British boyfriend Orlando Bloom.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is darkness and tragedy in the story, and it was a dream for me to land this part.\" Actress Sandra Dee continues to live in Los Angeles as a virtual recluse, but has given her approval to the biopic.\n",

      "\"She called me last week and said she loved it,\" said Spacey, who was joined at the premiere by members of the boy band Westlife. Spacey, a double Oscar-winner, has long been fascinated by the story of singer Bobby Darin. The voice behind Mack the Knife, Dream Lover and Beyond the Sea, fought childhood illness to become one the biggest stars of the 1950s, but died aged 37 from the heart condition that had troubled him all his life. \"Bobby Darin was one of the greatest entertainers the world has ever known, and yet, because he died young, he's been kind of forgotten,\" said Spacey at the premiere. \"Making this film was the most fun I've ever had in my entire life.\" The movie also stars British actors Bob Hoskins and Brenda Blethyn, as Darin's mother.\n",

      "\n",
      "The US Justice Department is to try to overturn a court ruling that threw out its claim for $280bn (£149bn) in damages from tobacco firms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier this month, a three-judge appeal court panel rejected the claim - filed in 1999 by the administration of Bill Clinton - in a 2-1 decision. Government lawyers said they would ask the full US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to hear the case. The court room battle is seen as key in government attempts to fight smoking. \"It's pretty clear that they've suffered a severe setback,\" said Anthony Sebok, a professor at Brooklyn Law School, adding that the appeal was what the government \"would be expected to ask for\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Prosecutors had argued that tobacco firms lied about the dangers of smoking, ignored research that highlighted problems, looked to increase addiction by manipulating nicotine levels and targeted the young with their adverts. Among the firms accused were Altria Group, RJ Reynolds Tobacco, Lorillard Tobacco, Liggett Group and Brown and Williamson. Prosecutors went after the companies using legislation put in place to fight organised crime, and accused the firms of conspiring and running \"Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations\". The tobacco companies denied the charges, saying that they never illegally conspired to promote smoking and fool the public. They also said that they have met many of the government's demands laid out in a landmark $206bn settlement hammered out in 1998 with 46 states. A three-judge panel agreed with the companies, finding that the case could not be brought under federal anti-racketeering laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "Central to the government's case was a meeting in the Plaza Hotel, New York, on 15 December, 1953. Prosecutors contend that executives from the major tobacco firms met and agreed to present a unified strategy denying the harmful effects of smoking. Despite denying for decades that smoking could be linked to illness, the companies have modified their stances in recent years. Altria's Philip Morris now accepts that nicotine is harmful, and the company's main lawyer William Ohlemeyer told the BBC last year that earlier statements may have been wrong but they were not dishonest. Government lawyers have until 21 March to file their appeal.\n",

      "\n",
      "The family of an Iraqi civilian allegedly killed by UK troops have won a challenge against the government's refusal to order a full inquiry.\n",
      "\n",
      "The High Court ruled on Tuesday that Baha Mousa's death in British custody in Iraq fell within the European Convention on Human Rights. And the judges paved the way for an independent inquiry by saying previous investigations were inadequate. But judicial reviews into five other deaths in southern Iraq were ruled out. Their families will be appealing against the judgement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The families' solicitor Phil Shiner described it as \"a historic day for human rights and the rule of law in the UK\". Father-of-two Mr Mousa, 28, a hotel receptionist, was arrested with eight men seized at a hotel in Basra in September 2003. He was allegedly beaten to death while in the custody of the Queen's Lancashire Regiment. The Iraqi families' lawyer argued that failing to adequately investigate the death breached the European Convention on Human Rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ministry of Defence lawyers argued the UK-controlled area of southern Iraq was outside European jurisdiction. But Lord Justice Rix and Mr Justice Forbes ruled that UK jurisdiction could extend to a UK-run prison, but did not apply \"to the total territory of another state\". They said as Mr Mousa was in custody when he died, his case came within the UK's jurisdiction. The other five Iraqis did not die in custody, so their cases had to fail, they said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it was difficult to say that the investigation which had already occurred \"has been timely, open or effective\", the judges said. After the ruling Carla Ferstman, legal director of the human rights organisation Redress, said: \"It is not enough for the military to investigate behind closed doors. \"There must be an effective public investigation by an independent official body. Only such an investigation could reveal what really happened and who might be responsible.\" Other allegations involving British soldiers included the shooting of an Iraqi police commissioner and the shooting of four Iraqi civilians in May 2003. Both sides were granted permission to appeal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prime Minister Tony Blair's official spokesman said: \"Obviously we will need to study this detailed judgment. I would point out, however, that a separate criminal case is currently being considered by the army prosecuting authority. \"I can't say anything further for obvious reasons. The MoD are considering whether to appeal.\" But former British Commander Colonel Bob Stewart said : \"Anyone at the top [of the military] will be saddened by the verdict that has taken place but will say: 'If there's a case to answer, let's have it out. Because we don't want people thinking that British soldiers beat up civilians and get away with it',\" he said. \"The Ministry of Defence does everything in its power to try to prove we act ethically and properly under the rules of war.\"\n",

The court in Washington found the case - filed by the Clinton administration in 1999 - could not be brought under federal anti-racketeering laws. Anti-smoking groups urge the government to fight on, but the Justice Department has not said if it will appeal.

      "Prosecutors wanted the cigarette firms to \"disgorge\" $280bn in profits accumulated over the past 50 years and impose tougher rules on marketing their products. They brought the case under racketeering laws, which were passed to deny mafia gangs the profits of their crimes. But the tobacco companies denied that they illegally conspired to promote smoking and defraud the public. They also said they had already met many of the government's demands in a landmark $206bn settlement reached with 46 states in 1998. The three-judge panel in the District of Columbia's Court of Appeals ruled on Friday that the US government could not sue the firms under the anti-racketeering laws. Judge David Sentelle, in his ruling, said such laws were aimed at putting an end to illegal conduct going forward. \"We hold that the language of (the law) and the comprehensive remedial scheme of (the law) preclude disgorgement as a possible remedy in this case,\" he wrote. The Justice Department refused to say if it would appeal. \"All we're saying today is that we have received the ruling and are reviewing it,\" a spokeswoman said on Friday. But William Corr of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids urged the government to continue pressing its case. \"Today's ruling should not be an excuse for this administration to seek a weak settlement that lets the tobacco industry off the hook,\" he said.\n",

      "\n",
      "Authorities in Philadelphia said they found insufficient evidence to support the woman's allegations regarding an alleged incident in January 2004. The woman reported the allegations to Canadian authorities last month. Cosby's lawyer, Walter M Phillips Jr, said the comedian was pleased with the decision. \"He looks forward to moving on with his life,\" he said. District Attorney Bruce L Castor Jr, who was in charge of the case, said that detectives could find no instance \"where anyone complained to law enforcement of conduct which would constitute a criminal offence.\n",

      "He also said that the fact the woman waited a year before coming forward, and she had had further contact with Cosby during that time, were also factors in his decision. The unidentified woman's lawyer, Dolores M Troiani, said her client was likely to sue the comedian. \"I think that's the only avenue open to her. She felt, as we did, that it's a very strong case and she was telling the truth.\" She also said that the woman supplied further evidence to prosecutors that she believed strengthened her allegations. Cosby emerged as one of the first black comics to have mainstream success in the US. He was a successful stand-up before hosting the children's show Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids, and starring in The Cosby Show, one of the biggest sitcoms of the 1980s.\n",

      "A senior barrister who has resigned in protest over the government's anti-terror laws says the current system is giving Britain a bad name.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ian MacDonald QC quit when the government failed to recognise a House of Lords ruling that detaining terror suspects indefinitely is unlawful. He was part of a 19-strong panel who have special security clearance to act for suspected terrorists. Five more barristers are now reported to be threatening to resign.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr MacDonald told BBC News: \"The reason why I am resigning is because I fundamentally disagree with locking people up without any trial for an indefinite period on reasonable suspicion. \"The current legal system is certainly having a very adverse effect on the Muslim community in Britain and the whole Asian community. \"I think it is giving Britain a bad name internationally\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act introduced by the government in 2001 in response to the 11 September attacks, foreign nationals suspected of involvement in terrorism who cannot be deported can be held indefinitely without trial. But Mr MacDonald believes that detainees currently being held should be entitled to a trial by jury. \"My own view is we need to have a full return to trial by jury, a proper criminal trial with proper accusations. \"As far as I'm concerned, the government have to start all over again and rethink their whole strategy for dealing with this.\" he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Attorney General Lord Goldsmith will receive a letter of resignation from Mr MacDonald on Monday. According to the Independent, his resignation is expected to be followed by those of five other barristers - Nicholas Blake QC, Andrew Nicol QC, Manjit Singh Gill QC, Rick Scannell and Tom de la Mare. They are all believed to be carefully considering their positions on the panel of Special Advocates who represent detainees before the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) - a secure court without a jury, which tries terror suspects. Mr MacDonald said he had \"no idea\" whether further resignations would follow. But Barry Hugill, a spokesman for the campaign group Liberty, told Radio 4's Today programme that more lawyers may go. \"I can assure that there is a distinct possibilty that more lawyers may be resigning,\" he said. \"They are now in a situation where everything they have been trained to believe in, the right to trial by jury, has been abandoned and that is what gives some of them sleepless nights.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Helena Kennedy, a Labour peer and a human rights lawyer, said the Special Advocates' main concern was that once they had seen any special intelligence they were not allowed to speak to the detainees. \"When this whole procedure was being considered immediately after 11 September there was a great deal of argument particularly in the House of Lords about whether there really was a process that could be considered a judicial review,\" she said. \"Without that you are having detention with no habeus corpus and really a blot, as Ian McDonald has said, on our legal landscape, something really quite shocking with regard to the rule of the law.\"\n",
