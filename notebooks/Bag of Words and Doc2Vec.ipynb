      "This is THQ&#65533;s fifth wrestling game for the Playstation. Since the original wrestling game they have come a long way, as now there are dozens of wrestlers like Steve Austin, the Rock, the Undertaker, Mankind and the Hardy Boyz featured in the game, but there are also dozens of match types, like ladder matches, casket matches, cage matches, table matches, tag team matches, handicapped matches, iron man matches, guest referee matches and so on! Another fantastic thing about the game are the details, like videos that play when wrestlers to come down to the ring. There are several different arenas to wrestle in, anything from the Smackdown and Raw arenas to Wrestlemania and Judgement Day (pay-per-view) arenas! The fans are also so detailed, they hold up signs based on who is wrestling in the current match. With all of that out of the way, the &#65533;season&#65533; mode is the best thing about the game. With a season mode, you chose a wrestler (you can chose a different wrestler during the season) and play an entire continuous year of WWF action. Wrestling week-by-week working your way up the ladder to the seven different WWF championships. There are even story lines to follow in the season, such as injuries, run-ins and the evil plots of the WWF&#65533;s owner Vince McMahon!\n",

      "Ask any gamer who also happens to be a fan of wrestling what video game has been the major hit series to own and most will say that the WWE SmackDown series of games has been THE must-own series since game one. 2 PSone titles and 4 PS2 titles later, the question had to be asked if THQ could make it 7 hit titles in all with the release of SmackDown vs Raw 2006.  The final answer is: OH YEAH!!!!WWE SmackDown vs Raw 2006 takes a major step up from last year's SD vs Raw by amping up what they felt the gamers wanted amped up and removing a few things that were not too liked.  One major boost is to the graphics.  As before, each of the wrestlers looks so close to their real life counterparts you would almost swear that you were watching an actual WWE show.  The stars come out to their actual entrances (moves and music) but yes, there are a few who it seems the theme clearances couldn't be gained.  Nevertheless it really is a major difference.Also new to the game are a few new match types to take on.  The Bra and Panties match that we loved dearly (admit it guys...:)) has now become the Fulfill Your Fantasy match in which you have to fill a \"Fantasy Meter\" to win the match.  It is fun, seeing as you get to start a pillowfight or go old school and try to rip your opponent's clothes off...Also added to the match types is the Buried Alive match.  In this match you have to fight your way up to a point on the stage where a coffin awaits.  There you must toss your opponent into the coffin, close the lid and win by basically burying your opponent.  This is a match that gets fun dependent on which superstar you use to take the match.  What's more is that it is one of 100 (!!) match types to take on in the game.Other new features include an all new General Manager Mode where you take on the role of GM of either show and try to go through a year by setting up matches and shows to garner the biggest fan base, Superstar specific storylines that change dependent on choices made throughout the season, a new Locker Room where the trophies and accolades you win through your wrestling are stored, an amazing roster of several current and former WWE Superstars including the legendary Bret \"Hitman\" Hart (THANK YOU!!!), the ability to steal your opponent's taunts and finishers, a new Possum Pin where you can fake out and pin your opponent, voices for your own created characters, the chance to take on either the WWE or World Heavyweight Champion in Exhibition mode and more.The few drawbacks come with the commentary during your matches, which come from Jim Ross and Jerry \"the King\" Lawler from Raw and Michael Cole and Tazz from SmackDown which sound at times like it was forced for them to read.  Also, the WWE Championship belt in all modes is the current \"Spinner\" championship held by Raw's John Cena.  Yet periodically you see the old \"modernized\" WWE Championship and you won't get that one.But even with these flaws, WWE SmackDown vs Raw 2006 sets the bar high for any future WWE titles (it is unknown if this is the final WWE title for PS2 with the PS3 on the horizon) and sends Midway a little message as it begins to make the game for WWE's main rival TNA Total Nonstop Action Wrestling.  As the tagline says, get ready for the fight of your life!\n",

      "I love WWF Smackdown!, and I've got the calluses on my thumbs to prove it.  I hear that WWE Smackdown! 2: Know Your Role is even better, but this first Smackdown! title puts every other wrestling game I have ever played to shame.  There is room for improvement, but there's little not to love about the wrestling action unleashed from this Playstation CD.  You have to start off with the wrestlers; you get all of the big names from WWF (now WWE) at the time, and most of them look great.  Chyna's animated character looks atrocious, with a tiny head set atop a mountain of muscles, but I have few other complaints in this department.  I am a fan of The Rock, and this game has really captured the style and look of my favorite wrestler, all the way down to the People's Eyebrow.  The moves also look fantastic and true to form, and the People's Elbow is a triumph of showmanship and fun.  Every wrestler has his/her big finishing move recreated in impressive detail, but even the little moves are impressive.  From the simple eye gouge to the dropkick or stomp or leg lock or bodyslam, the little details are all there to enjoy.  When you Irish whip your opponent into the turnbuckle, he goes bouncing off, staggers, and falls just like the guys do in real life.  Knock a guy to his rear end in the turnbuckle, and you can stand on his throat using the ropes for leverage; it's the little things like this that make this game so fantastic.  The controls are a little strange at first, but they quickly become second nature, and the best part about this aspect of the game is the diversity of moves you are able to execute.  When your opponent is lying in the ring, you can choose to try and cripple the guy's leg or get him in a semi-chokehold, with your action depending to some degree upon the angle in which you approach.  Then, when you've beaten your opponent to a pulp and the timing is right, you need only press one button (as opposed to an awkward combination of buttons and joystick moves) in order to execute your patented finishing move; of course, you'll want to do a little taunting first just to rub it in.  There are no pauses or hiccups at all in the action, I should note.The variety of matches is outstanding.  You can choose between normal matches, tag team matches, handicap matches pitting one against two, Battle Royals, Royal Rumbles, King of the Ring matches, hardcore matches where chairs, belts, and microphones are in easy rich and are encouraged for use in the ring, Anywhere Fall matches, cage matches, survival matches, and I Quit matches (which are especially fun).  Not only that, you can have or even control special referees for any match.  I love being a ref because you get to beat the heck out of either or both of the actual wrestlers, and you can control the outcome of the match by choosing the speed at which your three-count is made.  If all this isn't enough, there are a number of backstage fighting areas you can access (although the fact that you have to Irish whip your opponent into the backstage area makes this a little clumsier to pull off than it need be).But wait, there's more.  Not only does each wrestler have his own special introduction as he makes his/her way to the ring, the game features clips from backstage between some matches; this sounds pretty cool, but these clips soon become boring and frivolous.  You can choose to wrestle in Season Mode, taking your wrestler through each month on his/her own quest for the belt while watching or skipping over matches you don't actually participate in.  You also have the ability to create your very own wrestler and let him wreak some havoc in the big leagues, which is an option a lot of players should love.  Perhaps the best option of all, though, is the ability to set up the matches of your choice in Pay-Per-View events.  The only real complaint I have about this game is the fact that there is no option for match commentary.  I know that commentary can quickly become tiresome and repetitive, but it does make for a more realistic wrestling environment.  Other than this one missing option, though, WWF Smackdown! pretty much has it all, and I will be laying the smacketh down for some time to come, I can assure you.\n",

      "This is not a step forward from the last Raw game, instead it's a big step sideways. Raw 2 is like the game makers perfected the original Raw game (it only took them 2 years). First off this is a wrestling game, the player may select from one of over sixty WWE \"superstars\" to compete in a match. During this match the player may use different strikes by pressing the directional pad and the X button and may grapple his opponent by pressing the A button. When performing a grapple, the player can do a weak maneuver by pressing X and the directional pad or a strong maneuver by pressing A and the directional pad. Each WWE \"superstar\" in the game has their own moves, taunts, strikes, grapple maneuvers, high risk maneuvers and even ways to get in and out of the ring. Unfortunately there are not many submissions in the game, so everyone has the same half Boston crab submission. The game uses a new \"spirit\" meter that tracks how well the wrestler is doing, when the spirit meter is green, they are doing fine, when it is red, they are ready to do a finishing maneuver, and when it blinks danger, that person is ready to be finished. The wrestlers are big, bold, and life-like chiseled versions of themselves in the game. Even with the great graphics of the game, six wrestlers are allowed to compete at once, and even a referee is in the ring! The matches players can compete in are Normal Singles Matches, Tag, Triple Threat, Fatal 4 Way, Battle Royal, King of the Ring Tournaments, Cage, Hall in a Cell, and Tables, \"Ladders and Chairs\" (TLC). Despite the game allowing six people in the ring at once there are no six-man tag team matches, however there are Hall in a Cell Matches that allow six people and a referee in them. There are four different referees who count at different speeds, it can be extremely difficult sometimes, because the referees can count so slow you can never get a pinfall! There are fourteen arenas to compete in, Raw, Smackdown and all twelve of the Pay-Per-View Arenas (unlike the original Raw game that just had one arena). Now for the big part of the game, the modes, there are so many modes in this game! You have a quick play mode, for people that just want to throw a match together, an exhibition mode, so you can make your own match to play in, a season mode, which is an ongoing story where you compete show after show in matches, a King of the Ring mode, where you set up a bracket style tournament, a \"tournament\" mode, where you set up a bracket style tournament, but you can also make the match types yourself. a Royal Rumble mode, where its your wrestler against up to 64 other wrestlers that come to the ring; the object is to throw everyone else over the top rope. There are also design modes like \"create a superstar\" where you create your own wrestler and save up to 64 of them! \"Create a tag team\" that allows players to create either a two man or three man tag teams and create their entrances and a movie mode so you can see all the WWE superstar's entrance videos you have enabled. Now that you know all the modes, here are some in depth things about the Season mode and \"create a superstar\" mode. With the season mode, a month for the season consists of only one Raw, only one Smackdown, then that month's pay per view! The season mode works on a popularity system, lets say you play as Brock Lesnar, he is popular, Rico is not. So what does this popularity do? There are titles, the WWE championship, the \"World\" championship, Women's, Cruiserweight, Smackdown Tag, and Raw Tag. The popularity of the title-holder of the belt determines who can compete for that belt. World champion Triple would not let Spike Dudley compete for the belt, but he would let a popular superstar like Shawn Michaels go for the belt. So how do you get more popular? For each match of a TV show, you can do something to get more popular, you can win your match, interfere in someone else's match, sneak attack a wrestler, set a trap for a wrestler, call out a wrestler, manipulate a wrestler to attack your enemy, encourage an ally, find a manager, steal something (this is how you enable outfits and entrance videos), or break up with a tag partner. Everything you do can either get you more popular or less popular, and there is a chance you could fail doing these things. Everything you do will cost you spirit for your match on that show, so you could go into your match in \"danger.\" You can also build alliances and enemies in the season mode. Create a superstar is extremely detailed, everything from their in ring attire, their out of ring attire, their name, alliances, attributes, and \"character\" to their wrestling moves, and an extremely detailed entrance where you can pick their lighting, pyrotechnics (you can even time the pyrotechnics!), their entrance video (you can even make their entrance video with the created superstar), you can also use music on your X-Box for your superstar's entrance theme! Finally, there are over 60 wrestlers in the game, and here is a list: Austin, Goldberg, Batista, Big Show, Billy Gunn, Kidman, Booker T, Bradshaw, Lesnar, Bubba Ray, Chavo Guerrero, Val Venis, Benoit, Jericho, Christian, Chris Nowinski, Chuck Palumbo, Crash, D-Von, Eddie Guerrero, Edge, Goldust, Hardcore Holly, Hogan, Hurricane, Jacqueline, Jamie Noble, Jazz, John Cena, Kane, Kevin Nash, Kurt Angle, Lance Storm, Lita, Mark Henry, Matt Hardy, Molly, Nidia, Orton, Mysterio, Rhyno, Flair, Rico, Rikishi, Rob Van Damn, Scott Steiner, Shannon Moore, Shawn Michaels, Spike, Stacey Keibler, Stephanie McMahon, Steven Richards, Tajiri, Terri, Test, The Rock, Undertaker, Dreamer, Torrie, HHH, Trish, Victoria, and William Regal.\n",

      "&#34;Ladies and gentlemen, this is proof! Anything can happen in the World Wrestling Federation!&#34; those are the golden words spoken from Jim Ross to the player before the game opens with a custom made Smackdown intro to get you hyped and ready to play. From there, once you press start, you're taken into the menu screen with a cool color changing background and a mellow and orgasmic menu theme song. Seriously. When I was a kid, I used to leave it on the menu and fall asleep on the couch listening to the music. But on to the game!There were so many great things about this game, I don't know where to start, but I think I'll start with match types. There were new match types added to Smackdown 2 that were not in the first Smackdown game. These include a Ladder Match, a Hell In A Cell Match, a Casket Match, and a Tornado Tag Team Match. The Casket match was quite interesting as you had to either hit your opponent with the casket to make them fall inside of it or irish whip them inside of it. If they've been beaten up enough, you have to strike the casket enough times until the lid closes shut and you win the match. The Hell In A Cell match was also an interesting one. In the middle of each side of the ring was an escape door that could be broken by either running through or whipping your opponent through.The Hardcore Match is probably my favorite to play as the backstage areas were hugely updated from the previous Smackdown. You could fight in the arena lobby, take an elevator to the top floor and fight in the hallway, in the VIP Room, in the training room, in the parking lot, and in 2 new additions, the kitchen and WWF New York, and so much more! Did I mention that cars run you down in the parking lot if you get in the way? Hardcore matches truly are probably the most exciting and fun one to play just because of the endless places you can fight at. Don't want to stay in the ring? Take a trip backstage or outside of the arena! Whether you're playing a singles match, a Tag Team match, a Triple Threat or other, you'll enjoy playing Hardcore matches, no doubt!Along with the new match types, the roster was also largely increased. The roster is so overwhelming at first site as they include practically every WWF Superstar and Diva that was in the company at the time. From the main eventers, to the mid-carders, to the low-carders, to the divas, and even commentators! New additions to the game just to name a few, include, Viscera, Kurt Angle, Chris Benoit, Too Cool, Mean Street Posse, Crash Holly, Tazz, Lita, Rikishi, Perry Saturn, The Kat, Trish Stratus, Kaientai, Tori, Dean Malenko, Eddie Guerrero, etc. A few weird additions as playable characters include Pat Patterson, Gerald Brisco, and even Michael Cole. Other additions that had to be unlocked as well were Stone Cold, Commissioner Foley, Cactus Jack, Shawn Michaels, and more.The Season Mode was re-vamped and made longer than the previous Smackdown's season mode. You can play as a superstar or a diva. My only bone to pick about Season Mode is the ridiculous loading times. Each show includes about 8 matches and you can either watch the matches or simulate through them. If you simulate the matches, you're forced to endure dozens of unnecessary loading screens in between simulations to show cutscenes as simple as a superstar walking around backstage that may not even be relevant to the story you're in. The longer you play season mode, you'll encounter different stories and plots. Take out the unneeded loading times and you've got a stellar season mode to play.There's also a feature where you can have championship matches in Exhibition Mode. Only certain superstars could be used to defend the title against though. This would be the last time title matches were able to be played in Exhibition Mode until Smackdown vs Raw 2006.Overall: I'd say this was the best WWF game to be made. Out of Smackdown 1, Just Bring It, and all the other WWF games made before the Smackdown series, Smackdown 2 Know Your Role is the best and outshines them all!\n",

      "It was fun to play at first but now is very boring with a 24/7 mode it crushed Madden to bits. Even though that happened, Madden is the only football game on the market for 3 years. Madden's 2006 football game may be the last football game ever, so I would get Madden 2006. If you are GAGA over the ESPN series then rent this game, if you like it, you can buy it. I would suggest waiting for the new Madden but with ESPN NFL 2K5 you can't go wrong.\n",

      "Madden 2003 is by far the greatest pro football game of all time! The other EA game, NCAA Football 2003, is another great football game that could easily compete with Madden for best football game of the year. Madden's controlability, though, is better, and the graphics are by far the greatest in any sports game ever made up to this point! NFL 2K3 isn't even in the same league as Madden! Sure it's a great football game, but the graphics, controlability, AI, and the other game modes make Madden the most successful football game franchise of all time! I highly recommend this one to any football fan!\n",

      "I admit, I've been playing Madden for years. I'm so familiar with the Madden line that I can play the newest addition and tell you which positional AI was changed to provide a more realistic football game. Unfortunately, EA and Microsoft could never work out a deal regarding Xbox Live so the best way to play ANY football sim (human vs. human) isn't available on the Xbox's Madden unless you have company. Thus I decided to learn ESPN NFL Football.  Like everyone will tell you, ESPN Football has one heck of a slick presentation. The halftime and weekly highlights almost feel like you're watching ESPN Sportscenter.  Madden could learn a lot from ESPN's presentation. I usually ignore franchise mode when I play Madden but I thought ESPN had such a nice interface that I ended up playing the CPU a lot.  Unfortunately, I never could get used to the game mechanics of ESPN football.  One huge difference between Madden and ESPN is that players move much more realistically in Madden. Momentum is gone in ESPN and it almost feels like I'm controlling a player in an NFL Blitz game because it's so easy to cut and turn. But worst of all is the attrocious tackling in ESPN. You can play on the toughest difficulty level and an average halfback can look like Earl Campbell because he bounces off so many tackles. Speaking of difficulty levels, that was a real disappointment as well.  Basically, when you increase the difficulty, all it does is make the CPU tougher, and you worse.  So you can't tackle as well as your normally would but the CPU tackle goes way up!  There are a lot of things in ESPN I wish Madden would try and I think if someone were ever able to combine both games, we would get the perfect football sim, but for now I'll stick with Madden.  I would recommend ESPN for anyone that is new to football games as it's much easier to play than Madden and has an entertaining ESPN theme to it.  There's a reason why NFL players stick with Madden though, it's still the best football sim out there.\n",

      "What I mean by the title is this; the first time you play it, you won't be thinking \"game\" at all.Instead, you'll be pulled in by the surreal graphics, compelling storyline, and realistic characters.I can honestly say that this is my favorite game, due to the fact that it actually became part of my life, instead of me beating it and getting ready for the next game.I never knew what \"psychological damage\" was, exactly, until I played this.Though it didn't damage me in the ways of: I need to suicide or go do drugs, but more in the way of slight depression; nothing so serious that you'd need a shrink or anything, but more of a sadness.After you beat it the first time, you'll have most likely gone down the path you've chosen and have liked the way it turned out. If that's the case, the 2nd+ time you play it and go down a different path, you'll have to do certain things that you normally wouldn't. This is kind of what messes it up, because the first time you play it, you want your actions and responses to be right, or just how you want them to be. Then when you play again, you'll start feeling uncomfortable since you don't REALLY want to do the things you're doing, but just have to do it to see the other endings.After I played it the first time, then started on the 2nd/3rd play through, it started becoming more of a game, and was \"easily-put-downable\" when I started getting frustrated/bored. (Not really frustrated or bored, but the first time you play it you don't want to stop playing because you HAVE to see what happens next, but after you play it once, it loses the gripping factor.)People will say that the shocking twist near the end of the game ruins it; I say otherwise.Though I can agree that it \"may\" ruin it, I still like the way the characters react and deal with the situation.So for me, the game never goes into an \" aw, that ruined my whole experience! \" moment, ever.There are 57 trophies in the game, in which you are awarded by doing specific and particular things within each chapter.I updated this game the moment I got it, which was a tedious 1.1gb download, and with my slow internet I had to wait a whole day until it finished.I never played it before I patched it, but I figured if I'm going to play it, I might as well download the patch; seeing as it fixed camera issues, new main menu and supposedly bonus content (making-of videos).I got the version of Heavy Rain without the blue PS Move compatible logo, so I don't know if that version has the update pre-installed or not, seeing as it's the Move Compatible version.But the patch installed on the previous version installs the Move patch as well, so everyone can enjoy Move no matter what version they have.It's very hard to express why this game is great without telling spoilers; but if you're like me, I didn't want to see a single video of Heavy Rain before I got it, because I knew it would ruin everything - and I can say, if I had watched a video of Heavy Rain prior to gameplay, I would have been upset seeing as playing this game without knowledge of anything is the best way to go.I don't even know if I've started the review yet, but let me start explaining the aspects of the game.The game is single player, has trophies, and has 1 Downloadable Content episode (the game creator has basically said that after they finished working on PS Move version of Heavy Rain, and they started working on new DLC they figured it would waste time, and said that they would rather work on a new project, instead of spending more time on Heavy Rain.)Which I find stupid, how can you \"waste time\" on something that can still be played?But, I am fine with this, especially after playing the first and most-likely only DLC.(*1*) - GRAPHICS: 9.0The graphics in this game are spectacular, the skin textures and overall ambiance are better than any game I've ever seen.I watched video reviews, (after the fact), and I saw that they were all complaining about a few things, one in particular is how this game is supposed to be a cinematic presentation-styled game, yet some scenes of the game's textures are terrible.This is true, even though I don't feel that way about it.I admit, some scenes will have the character's face slimy-looking and textureless, and while these scenes and moments in the game come a little bit too often, it doesn't ruin gameplay aspects, but it will be noticeable and might have an awkward \" uhh \" effect on you and anyone watching you play it.Other than that, graphics are great, one of the few games (if not only) that actually makes rain in a game look good.----------------------------------------------------------(*2*) - STORYLINE: 10I might be a bit off with giving it a 10, but I'll explain.As I've said above, the first time you play it, you just know that the game is just what you're looking for (if you're looking for one of the few great Mystery/Crime games.)Some people will say the game is very slow and boring in the beginning, but quickly ramps up after an hour or so; but I say different. I'm actually pleased that the game developers gave the audience time to introduce the characters, instead of just starting the game in mid-battle or like you already know them and are well-acquainted;The story introduces each character and shows you what their issues are, or what they have to deal with daily, and gives you a starting point on how you want to play with your characters.What I didn't know in the beginning, though now I do, is why all your actions, in the beginning and middle of the game, don't actually change anything towards the story or the ending.But now I see that it's because the game is trying to shape your opinion of your character.It's basically testing you in the beginning/middle of the game, to see what you want your characters to do when it all starts coming down.I do agree, though, that the game gets a lot better after your choices REALLY start to mean something.You honestly start to feel sad and scared when your characters are in near-death experiences.This is the FIRST game EVER, that I was actually scared for my CHARACTERS life in any game.It wasn't like \"Oh no, I'm gonna die\", it was more like \"OH NO, NORMAN'S GONNA DIE!!!!!11!!!1!111!\"It tells you something if you're playing a game, and are actually scared for your characters, instead of only scared that you, yourself, are about to lose a battle.People also say that the characters are good and all, but aren't enough for you to connect with them and get a chance to feel for them. I could say that it's true and untrue. Reason is, you don't ever feel like you're INSIDE your character, but more like you're just looking at them from the outside. However, who can say that being inside them is so great?From what I've seen, looking at them from the outside is still an emotional ride. I felt for each character like it was someone I knew going through these things (all thanks to the introductory part of the game.)This would have to be my favorite storyline of any game, because it's one game that actually left it's mark in my memory; a solid mark.---------------------------------------------------------(*3*) GAMEPLAY - 9.0It's hard to say when it comes to this game's gameplay. I don't know how to explain it.I've read that people say that this game is just one big quick time event, and that they will hate Q.T.E.'s in any game they play from now on. My ending results didn't tally up to that one.There ARE a lot of Q.T.E.'s, but it isn't so much to the point of you wanting to destroy all Q.T.E.'s.I never had a problem with it, or even moments where I thought to myself: \"When will this be OVER!!?!?!?\"When it comes to movement in games, you'd think move the analog left or right to go left or right, but this game is a little bit different. Yeah, you move by holding R2, then moving the left Analog stick in which way you want to go, but it's a bit hard at times. Specifically moments where the camera automatically switches when you walk pass a certain point, then you try to turn left or something, then you'll start going backwards and the camera flicks back to the way it was before you CAME to that point. All in all, it's annoying, but only when you get to those moments in the game.But with that aside, movement in this game is realistic, and never at a time does it make you tired of walking.My game has only gotten stuck 2 times, even though I've had it just a week, but to my knowledge and what I've seen, the game doesn't get stuck every chapter, maybe like just once the whole game.-------------------------------------------(*4*) SOUND - 9.5Personally I love the soundtrack, it complements the weary ambiance and sad game tone, and adds to what you feel for your character. People say that the characters' voices in the game are at-times: terrible. I could agree, but then I think of the reason why people are saying they're terrible. Everyone's voice in the game is pretty much top-notch, except the character Norman Jayden.His voice can sound tremendously weird at times, and will make you a little bit scared for no reason at all.The voice actor would turn some words into the weirdest thing yet. Example; a sentence he said in the game was similar to this: \"All the victims were drowned in rain water.\"  Ok, sound right? Well this is how he pronounced it:\"All the victims wuh drowned in rain wahtuh.\"  It's kinda creepy; it does it on similar occasions in parts of the game.But then, I realized something. This game was made in Europe (Quantic Dream is a European based company) IE: SCEE (Sony Computer Entertainment Europe.) And I guess to people, the way he pronounces things would make them think \"Why is this an American game, and is supposed to be American characters, yet the voices sound like they aren't?\" And for some reason, they think of it as a negative, and that it's bad voice acting.But this game ISN'T American. And though the game's story is based on the east coast of USA, (most likely somewhere along the lines of New York), who says the characters in the game ARE American? Especially with Norman Jayden being an FBI agent, not normally stationed in this east coast city.So I just disagree with statements such as it's an American game, with non-American voice actors.But I will say that at times, at least every character has 1 moment in the game where they sound weird.---------------------------------------------(*5*) MISCELLANEOUSBefore I got this game, I was quite worried about the nudity in the game.Reading on websites, it kind of made it seem like a full-on, non-stop, \"IN YO FACE\" kind of thing.This is NOT the case. There are just 3 times in the game in which you encounter these scenes.Only 1 time will you be unable to bypass it. (2 times if you want a platinum trophy)The first scene you'll be forced to watch, it's Ethan in the shower.It doesn't show anything in the front, just his butt. It may seem like it's going to show more than that with the way the camera moves, but that's it. It gets a bit weird when he gets out and you have to shake the controller to dry him off with a towel..The 2nd scene is when you play with Madison, she'll have an OPTION to take a shower, in which she takes off her clothes, walks into the walk-in shower, and it shows her breasts and butt, that's all.Again, it may seem like they're going to show more than that, but they won'tIt all depends on your views.This scene isn't needed to get a trophy; you don't even have to go into her bathroom at ALL to beat that chapter.The 3rd scene, however, IS needed to get a trophy, seeing that there's something that happens after the fact, and depending on your actions, will earn a trophy.I won't say who, but you're given the choice to kiss a person, or not to kiss.If you kiss the person, then they'll start having some sex! xD But no, what they really do is start kissing, then lay on the floor. You'll have some INTERACTION with the scene, like to either unhook so and sos Bra, or to change position...The only nudity they show in this scene is so and sos Right breast, I'm not sure if they show any butt, but yeah...Depending on your views, this might be something to run home about. And I can say, it's kinda awkward if someone is watching you play, however, it does change the story/ending depending on which you choose. So, good luck with-a-THAT.There are a few bugs, such as during a movie scene where characters are talking to each other, and then some people that are walking around will just walk straight through the characters or any object, such as a desk or wall.I can say that it's really weird when it happens, but it's only a few times during the whole game, and ruins nothing at all.There are also some weird times where the characters facial expression doesn't quite match the situation...You'd know when you see it.It may sound like there are just bugs and problems at every which way, but it's only a few, and is spread out through the whole game, and by the time you encounter one, you'd have forgotten about the previous ones.(*5*) OVERALL - 10At the end of the day, I give this game a 10; because of how the story is told, and what the game makes you feel for the characters is just too realistic. And for a GAME to make me actually fear the outcome and possible regret of a situation is just wonderful. And even though I said the game gets a bit boring after the 3rd or so play through, this is still a game that should not be passed by. If like me, you'll connect to the characters. At first, I didn't like Norman Jayden, and had liked Ethan the most, but after I played it again, I started liking Norman more and more.This is an Action/Adventure, Drama, Mystery/Crime, and Romance.I really hope that this game has created a new genre of games, as I also loved Indigo Prophecy.There just aren't enough, if any, games like this, and have added Quantic Dreams to my list of favorite companies.I hope this review helped.\n",

      "Sorry in advance for a long review, but every once in a while something comes along that is well worth the extra words, and this is one such item.This game is, simply put, a masterpiece.I'm an avid gamer. I play a lot of games...a lot. I try to play a wide variety of games: different genres, different systems, some casual, some \"hardcore\", and most in-between. Gaming is my favorite way to relax. All that being said, this is--by far--my favorite game of all time. Truly.Let me start by saying that I had never played any of the Metal Gear Solid games previously. I barely knew anything about them. When I first got a PS3, and saw how many excellent reviews MGS4 got, I decided to give it a shot.Boy, am I glad I did.For the next month or so, every spare moment I had (which, at the time, came in fits and starts) was spent engrossed in this incredible world. The amazing thing about this game is that it does everything well. There are no weak aspects of the game. How many games can say that? Not many.Some games have great graphics, some have a great story, some have a cool environment/world, some have great characters, some have great action, great shooting, great exploring, etc. Some have great hidden items to find, great secrets or unlockables; some have great cut-scenes, animations, and so forth. But rarely does a game do all of these things well. Most often, games only do one or two of these things well.This game does everything well.Gameplay - Although every aspect of this game is phenomenal, the gameplay is where it really shines. What's incredible is that you can approach every situation however you choose. You can sneak stealthily; you can go in with guns blazing and take out everyone; you can blast through groups of enemies, or take them out one by one.There are multiple paths to each destination; you can take direct routes, use roundabout approaches, or find secret passages that are scattered throughout the game. The missions are varied, as is the gameplay itself.There are many different weapons, most of which can be upgraded in various ways. The enemies are varied...I love the mix of human soldiers, robots, and \"hybrids\", all of which are truly remarkable and believable (rather than being poorly done or cheesy, as is so often the case). The bosses are of particular note, as they are quite varied (and some are notably tough), and each has their own identity and means of attacking. Awesome.Plot/Story - I came into this game not knowing anything about the Metal Gear Solid universe, characters, or plotlines. I've heard a lot of people say that they found this story to be confusing. I didn't think it was confusing in itself, though I did feel that I would have benefited from having played the earlier games in the series.The game does include an encyclopedia (of sorts) that outlines much of the earlier stories, but who wants to read through all of that tedium? Not me. I just experienced the game on its own, and it's a very good story.This isn't fluffy, shallow stuff either; it deals with themes of freedom vs. slavery (a different kind, but slavery just the same), family relationships, the nature of love, good vs. evil...even dealing with getting old (the idea of playing as an old man didn't appeal to me at all beforehand, but he turned out to be one of the most memorable and remarkable characters I can remember in a game). Great stuff.Much ado has been made about the lengthy cut-scenes. Some people hate them. And yes, there are a number of them that are quite long (longer than in any other game I've ever played, I think). It didn't bother me at all...for me, it was all part of the larger experience.If you're an ADD gamer and just want action, action, action, then this game may not be for you. But if you see gaming as an art form and want to experience the full beauty of this game, then don't fight the cut-scenes. Accept that they are part of the whole masterpiece, and experience the game as one incredible piece of art. Just be prepared to sit through some pretty long scenes. You might be tempted to skip through them (and, for the most part, you can), but you'll miss out on a lot of the story, and the experience...plus there are a number of cool hidden things you can do during the cut-scenes. Very cool.Graphics - This is still one of the best looking games on any console, ever. It really showcases the power of the PS3. Environments are rich and deep. The small details are what make the world really live: smoke effects, dust particles floating around, light shafts breaking through the sky. Just amazing.The characters look fantastic. They look very realistic without that \"creepy\" thing going on that so many games have. When most games attempt realistic-looking faces, they just end up looking weird and slightly \"off\". Not so here. The character animations aren't perfect, but they're among the best I've yet seen...even with some of the very recent developments in this area, a few years after this game's release.The environments are varied and lush...from dry dusty deserts to snowy mountains, lush jungles, and urban sprawl. Really well done.Sound - The sound is excellent. Music that builds suspense, weapon effects that really make you feel like you're using them, and great voice acting. I wouldn't buy the soundtrack, necessarily, but the music is just about perfect for this game, and I did download all of the extra and unlockable tracks that I could. There are even podcasts that you can listen to on your in-game iPod while moving through the game. So cool.Bang For Your Buck - This is a long game, and that is by no means a bad thing. Some games you just think, \"I wish this would end already.\" Other games, you feel ripped off because they're so short. Then there are games that either feel like they are the perfect length, or you feel like you could continue playing for a long time after but are by no means upset that the game is over because the length and the whole experience were so satisfying. This is one of the latter types of games.Even more rare for me is to have the desire to replay a game. Some games I don't even finish the first time, and I can count on one hand the number of games I've played completely through more than once. I just started on my fourth time through this game. While I've started a second play-through on a few games, it's very rare for me to finish on the second go-round. I also have a lot of other games in my \"queue\" that I'm waiting to get through, yet I still come back to play this one frequently. That says a lot.Yes, there are a lot of lengthy cut-scenes, but even if you skip through them, the game is quite long. This is a meaty, engrossing game, and well worth the investment. You won't want it to end!Fun Factor - Simply put, this is the most fun I've ever had with a game. I'm not real big on the \"stealth\" kinds of games, which I usually find incredibly boring...skulking around and trying to sneak past enemies quietly instead of blowing them up or shooting them in the face...and this series is known for being all about stealth.But because you can play it any way you want, I had an absolute ball. Even the places where I chose to approach things using stealth instead of brute force, I actually had fun. I never felt forced into that approach, and I was never bored.There is just so much to do, so many ways to do it. I actually cared what happened to the characters, and the upgrades, unlocks, and all the secret/hidden stuff just add icing to the cake. An absolute blast.This is not a lighthearted, frivolous fun kind of game...this is an experience you want to savor and sink your teeth into.Gameplay - 10/10Plot/Story - 9.5/10Graphics - 10/10Sound - 9.5/10Bang For Your Buck - 10/10Fun Factor - 10/10Overall - 10/10 (not an average)Verdict: My absolute favorite game of all time. Much more of an experience than \"just a game\". A work of art, this game truly is a masterpiece. I cannot recommend it highly enough.\n",

      "This is the first game I've purchased and played regularly in over three years except for Final Fantasy XI. Thanks to that game i've not found enough time for very many other games unfortunately. I am however a big fan of the Wii Virtual Console titles though I guess.I recently purchased a few new XBOX 360 games and tried to base all my purchases on reviews. My purchase of this game was based on a few reviews and on a very good trailer for the game.Put in the game and found the controls to be very hard to get used to. I'm one of those weird people who press up to look down and press right to look left. Of course it didn't take long to adjust to this. It seems that most Xbox 360 games do not have setting to invert both the X and Y axis. No big deal.My character of course starts out as a kid and when I become an adult I'm told to wait for Theresa to continue the main storyline. Of course I spend the next two days wandering around Bowerstone just doing random things for fun. Mostly annoying people or trying to make money. I took on the Blacksmith job and got to level 5 and made around 65k the first day to make enough money to buy some real estate. It's best to purchase cheap stalls and work your way up. I increased the prices on the Liquor store by a lot and of course that's not a good idea to this game and all the drunks in the game would get mad at me! My first thought on the first day was that this game is going to take forever to finish and that there's way to much to do in this game. That's unfortunately not true.After the first few days of wasting time in the main village I decided to get into the game for real. The combat is pretty much the best. I couldn't have hoped for something better really. Some people could say it's simply button smashing, but I don't really think so. What's especially cool is being able to use a pistol and zoom in for head shots and hit people from a distance. Often i'd get into the habit of trying to kill off all the enemies with just a pistol or when I got really good, just do head shots on everyone.I may sound like i'm an evil character, but i'm not. In the game I was so good that I actually had a halo. Strangely though after the first day I got so fat due to me taking 4 drinks in a row in the bar for fun. I also later found out that I was 100% corrupt and my character looked sickly. Of course I found out that it was because I jacked up the prices on too many rental properties to make money.Through the whole game, not once was I confused where to go next and what to do. In some ways, that can be a negative. I did go out exploring, but having every single thing pointed out to you gets a bit old. Yes I know that I can remove the \"yellow line\" thing.I honestly loved this game so much at first that I was telling everyone about it. At first I thought it was one of the best games I had played in years. Absolutely NOTHING in the game felt like a chore to do. Pretty much every single thing in the game was fun.I worked extra hard to take work off early just to play this game (I work at home) and managed to finish this game in less than a week after I purchased it. Please note that i'm not one of those hardcore gamers or whatever you want to call them. I only play games when I have free time. I will admit that often i'd play this game on my day off for up to five hours.So here I was at the end of the game. I figured there would be a lot to do. At the end of the game I had about 250k. I'm sure a lot of people have had more than that, but I didn't spend a ton of time making money. I also got into a bad habit of buying way to many weapons. The first thing I did was buy as much real estate as I possibly could. This includes buying any shop I could possibly find. I was actually amazed at how stupid easy it was to make money in this game. By the end it only took me a day or so to make enough money to buy Fairfax Castle. This is with no cheats. I also did not leave my character on all night to make the money roll in faster. A few days after getting the Castle I was back up to 2.5 million. That was with zero gold augments or any work at the bar or at the blacksmith shop.A couple days after beating the game I had pretty much purchased every single property you could possibly buy in the game (except for Temple of Shadows). I also went and shot down every single Gargoyle I could find and got the Legendary Crossbow in return. I found that many of the legendary weapons are a waste of time to bother finding.So now four days after I beat it, i'm running around to find things to do in the game. I was so bored that I killed everyone in town since I was so sick of being good the entire time. There's absolutely nothing fun left for me to do. Trying to get all the achivements is not my idea of fun. Sometimes i'll run through old dungeons just for fun, but some of them you can't access anymore unfortunately.To say the least, this game left a bad taste in my mouth. I'm kind of disgusted that the game was so short. I didn't feel like I rushed through it. The game could be easily beaten in one week of casual playing. The game is \"M\" rated, but it feels as if it was meant for children because the whole game feels like it's in Easy Mode. It's true that I'd prefer a game that's not super difficult, but this game is way too easy. It's not as if I used dozens of potions or an HP augment everywhere I went. I didn't even use any of the legendary weapons to beat the game. Even on the first trip into the Crucible I got perfect founds on all buy two. On the second try I got the Legendary Weapon.There are a few decent challenges in a few dungeons. I especially loved the ones where they seemed to throw dozens and dozens of enemies at you and you didn't think it'd ever end. There were a few where my fingers hurt from all the waves of enemies they sent at you. I don't remember which dungeon it was, but those were my favorites. I especially loved the Pirate Ship and the Charlie's Hat Quest. The biggest challenge for me was to get the Red Dragon pistol. I'm so terrible at manually targeting with the controller that I may never get it. My highest score has been only like 160 or something.The \"bosses\" in this game are a real joke. Sometimes I had no clue that whatever one I was fighting was actually the boss or not. I swear that one of them died in one head shot and I didn't even really get a good look at him. When I went to Wraith Marsh for the first time I figured the Banshees would be really difficult, but this definitely isn't the case. The only fairly difficult enemies in the game are the Spire Soldiers that throw spikes at you and some of the Trolls.For the price of this game, I just expect more for my money. I could have rented this game once or twice and finished it. I think I may just end up replaying the game over with a rusty weapon or something and see how that goes. I think Lionhead Studio owes us one by providing an update to add something in there to keep people playing. Hopefully in the next fable they will open up a difficulty option or at least have that be an option after you beat the game. What would be really nice is if they released a patch to allow all enemies to respawn, but that probably would never happen. Something to make everything more difficult.They just needed to come up with more dungeons in the game that offered a really big challenge.Believe it or not, in this game I got \"knocked down\" 3 times. The only time I remembered this happening was in the spire the second time around. No clue how that happened. It wasn't even at the boss fight.There's also quite a few bugs i've found, but most people will never experience any of them. My wife would randomly get scared of me for absolutely no reason and act like I was going to kill her. I also found my children talking around me about their dad, when I was standing right there. It's the same dialogue that other children in the area used as well. I also once stupidly moved my home to Brightwood Tower and both my children and wife would get lost. I'd try to find them for 15 minutes with no luck, but eventually did and had to move. Children in the game are the biggest annoyance to me. They all follow me around and always seem to say the same two things, mostly telling me to wait for them. I also really hated how every single woman in the game would walk into my house with hearts over their head. Using the dismiss motion didn't really seem to always help. I wish I could have just closed my door. Even when I wake up, they're just standing there! One last bug i've seen is one day I had \"Leave your house to exit Redecorate mode\" for like 4 hours on my screen! Even when changing areas it would not go away. I also found that if you have two of the same weapons with different augments, both get selected and only one of them will work correctly.Found the graphics pretty good, but I don't really play many other games to compare it with. The slowdown during menus is pretty annoying. I also hated how you're required to use the main menu way too much.One other negative about this game is that some things are useless in this game. Magic was rarely needed for me. Some people use it all the time, but not me. Only in the Crucible did I use it a lot. I also felt that with weapon augments, there was not a huge difference. I rarely noticed it. I don't have a clue why they didn't let you remove augments. I also hated how to find a good weapon with two augments you'd have to do a lot of running around. Shops and merchants often don't have them and it seems all random. One place that had them now doesn't. That merchant seems to have disappeared! Clothing Shops were nice to have in the game, but what's the point of it other than being able to customize it? How about armor with actual stats? I don't mean ones for your personality. Yes, I know that this game was never meant to be like Final Fantasy or World of Warcraft..Anyway, I did love this game, but it's way too short and way too easy. I just finished the game and just wanted more. I have no doubt that this game could be finished in under a few hours by someone that's beaten it a few times. I'm sure hoping that new expansion pack for this game will give me something more to do and keep me busy for at least a couple more days. If they release a Fable 3 I hope it's much longer, a bit more difficult, it's not rushed by Microsoft and they have more people working on it.\n",

      "Holy hot jimmies, this game is good! Borderlands 2 is truly a unique gem in the increasingly popular first person RPG genre.  The game's style and feel reminds me of a mix of Trigun, Unreal Tournament, and a little bit of Bioshock and Fallout 3. Also it's funny as hell. It's been a while since I've seen a game like this that has such personality to go with the overall fun factor of the game play. Now this is unusual for me because I usually don't really care for these massive, open world, first person RPGs like Skyrim or Fallout 3. That is part of the reason I avoided this game for awhile. It took some convincing to finally get around to playing this game and boy was I wrong. The game play is very addictive, the story is simple but good and well-done, the characters are some of the best video game characters I have seen in years, and it puts lots of new spins on the usual FPS conventions. It's definitely not the deepest RPG experience out there but it doesn't need to be. Now I have not played the first game but you don't really have to play the first to understand this game, though it was made me very interesting in playing the original Borderlands now. Review time, go now!STORY: Set on the planet Pandora (not the one with the blue cats) which holds legends of all kinds of vaults that hold mythical amounts of treasure. Treasure hunters known as Vault Hunters come from all over the galaxy come to this planet seeking a legendary vault hidden within the planet. The planet is controlled by the Hyperion Organization which is under control of Handsome Jack (isn't that the best name ever?) who has been luring hunters to the planet to kill them off to keep them from getting to the vault so he can keep it for himself and so the company can freely mine Eridium from the planet. Today, four Vault Hunters, Salvador, Maya, Axton, and Zer0 have made it to the planet and discover Handsome Jack's trap and end up left for dead near the planet's pole. Pandora itself is a land of danger filled with arctic glaciers, deserts, wastelands, steep valleys, mountains, and volcanoes. In those lands they are filled with native creatures, bandits, psycho paths, killer freaks, robots, and other horrors you must face, plus Handsome Jack as a deadly plan for those on the planet who are trying to resist him.You also encounter some strong allies in these borderlands. This game has some of the coolest characters I've seen in a video game in awhile. There are characters like Scooter who is your typical redneck mechanic that has some questionable love interests, Dr. Zed your go to person for health with a questionable medical license, Marcus the gun seller who is always trying to make a buck, Miss Moxxi the sexy bar owner, Tiny Tina a mentally unstable 13-year old that is an expert with explosives, and Claptrap. Oh, Claptrap. He's one of the silliest robots ever in a video game. Handsome Jack makes for one of the best villains I've seen in a video game who is just constantly harassing you throughout the game. He's such a condescending jerk but at the same time he's hilarious. The cast from the first game also become major characters as the story progresses. I am also happy to see that the characters that you play as are not just silent protagonists like you see in most games like this. While they do not talk directly with NPCs, they do talk and make wise  remarks during combat. I prefer to have a character with personality than one that just stays silent throughout a game even though they are the hero.The game's story length is surprisingly long. It's taken me about three weeks to complete but I've also been working at the side quests which there very many of. While the main missions are generally interesting and keep the story moving along, the side missions are a lot of fun as well. They range from massive treasure hunts, taking on a town filled with bandits, to something as simple as shooting a guy in the face who literally asked for it. While the game is long and has some epic boss fights, including the last boss, it does have a disappointingly short ending like many games these days and kinds sets it up for another game. BUT it's not like that's it, there are still plenty of side missions to do and a few open up to you after you complete the main missions so there is plenty to do after the credits roll.GAMEPLAY:  If you like shooting and looting then you will love this game because you're going to be doing it A LOT. This game has soooo many guns. I really have no idea how many guns are in it because I seem to be always discovering new ones. Not only do you have the usual classes of guns such as assault rifles, pistols, sniper rifles, SMGs, and rocket launchers, you also have elemental based guns. They have one of five elemental effects such as electricity, acid, fire, slag (a chemical that causes enemies to take more damage), and explosive. They also take the usual shooter clich&eacute; of red explosive barrels and adds in barrels that hold these elements to use strategically during gun fights. I have no idea how they have barrels of electricity but they are fun to shoot. In addition to your guns and grenades, you also have various shields which take another convention of modern shooters and makes it deeper. You can find, buy, or make better shields throughout the game and they all recharge at certain rates. Your shields recharge but your health does not. You'll need to find health items for that which I rather like because I'm tired of the easy-peasy take cover and you'll heal right up health system most games these days use. You will find money, ammo, guns, shields, and other goodies all over the place in this game and you will constantly be looting containers. It becomes very addictive. Also when you find new guns, shields, ect, a screen appears that shows the item's stats and makes it easy to compare with the items you currently have. You can carry a lot on you but over time you'll find yourself have to decide on dropping or keeping various items throughout the game.In addition to all of your weapons, each class has their own individual special ability. There are four classes: Gunzerker who can duel-wield weapons of any find, Siren (which is the character I am using) that has a psylock power that lets her hold enemies in the air with psychokinetic abilities, the commando who can deploy turrets, and the assassin who can make decoys of himself. As you level up you can develop these characters as you want and they have their own unique abilities to gain. In addition to that, there is the Bada** ranking system (yes, that's what it is called and censored for this amazon review). There are hundreds of challenges to complete throughout this game and each time one is completed you get a bada** token which you can use to improve various aspects of your character such as improving weapon accuracy or melee damage. This game constantly rewards you for your actions and improvement.The characters are customizable in appearance but not nearly as deep as some first person RPGs. You do unlock different color skins and hair styles throughout the game but that's it so if you're looking to make a character that looks like you, you're going to be disappointed. However, I really don't mind much since these characters do actually have personality to them unlike in other similar type RPGs. However, another department that really could have used the customization is the weapons. While there are many, being able to add on optics or other attachments would have been nice. If you want an assault rifle with an optic, you pretty much just have to be lucky and find one. Also there are vehicles in the game, well, two to be exact. More vehicles would have been cool to see. Also, enemies have a flying vehicle but you never get to use one. I find that disappointing especially in one mission were it looks like you finally fly one but end up having to blow it up instead, though it leads to some funny dialogue afterwards. However, the biggest complaint I would have about this game is respawning enemies. After awhile, enemies will return to an area after you kill them. I understand it's to help gain exp for leveling up BUT why do the bosses come back? Especially, if it's a boss directly tied in with the main story. You do get the same about exp but I've never seen a game bring bosses back like that. It makes you think what was the point of fighting them? Anyway, it's not game breaking and if you want to relive a boss fight you can easily do so.The final thing I'd like to point out is that this is NOT an easy game. If you are not experiences with FPS games then you might want to take it slow with this. The guns fights you get in this game very chaotic, fast paced, and intense. I've played many FPS games before I still find parts where I die over and over again. You respawn at check points, though it does cost money and you're treated to a wise remark from the automated voice from the respawn machine. This game is completely co-op though so if you're having too much trouble, grab a friend in person or online and you can play the game together!GRAPHICS: One of the things that make Borderlands' style is the cell shaded graphics. Nearly the entire game is cell shaded and gives it this comic book/graphic novel look to it. It's really cool and colorful despite the arid landscapes of Pandora. However, this does come with a price. There is a lot of texture pop-in.  It's at its worst when loading up a game or loading up a new area and you will be seeing a lot of smaller pop-in throughout the game. I did also notice some frame rate slow down here and there but it was rather rare and not game breaking. I have a feeling this is not as much of an issue on the PC versions of the game. The character models look awesome. Some of the most unique character designs I've seen in a game in awhile and excellent personalities to go with them.SOUND: The sounds of gunfire and explosions will fill your speakers and you play through this game but what really steals the show is the voice acting and dialogue. This is one of those games where you'll want to go around and talk to everyone just to hear the crazy stuff they are going to say. This is bolstered by excellent voice acting which oddly enough has a lot of anime voice actors in it. From the main characters to the crazy psycho babble of the bandits, the voice acting in this game is lots of fun. The music is sadly less memorable. While it is definitely fitting with the sci-fi western setting, it's just nothing I really care to listen to without the game. It reminds me a lot of the background music for Trigun. Fitting but nothing without its source.Overall, I recommend Borderlands 2 as one of the must play games of 2012. This game is so much fun and entertaining to play through. Considering that there are four different classes, it adds even more replay value to the game in addition to the already plentiful amount of side missions. There are already plenty of DLC missions for it as well. I know I'm going to get a lot of hate for this but I think this is the way an FPS/RPG should be done and I strongly prefer it over games like Fallout 3. I recommend this game for anyone who loves FPS games but is tired of Call of Duty or Halo. I also recommend it to fans of Fallout and Elder Scrolls games and action junkies. Even if you aren't crazy about the game play, you should still be able to find some laughs out of this unique and fun game.OVERALL: 9/10\n",

      "----I'm updating my review because I feel that some reviewers are being way to harsh just because they've played the first Buffy game and aren't giving this one a chance.  When I first started playing it I found it difficult to get used to because I was expecting it to be like the last game.  Well it's not the first game so get over it.  Give this game a chance and you might be surprised at how much you enjoy it!  Also, as a comparison, go and check out the reviews of the Playstation 2 and Gamecube versions and you will see that a lot of people really, really like this game and aren't ripping it apart like some of the XBox fans.  These people aren't comparing it to the first game because the first game was only released on Xbox.  Also keep in mind that the Xbox version is considered far superior than the other two versions.  Once you've played a level or two and have gotten used to the controls being different from the first game you can really start to get into it.  In my family there are four of us and we all played the first game and loved it.  We all had a hard time in the beginning getting used to the differences in this game but all agree that it is a great game.  This is coming from a 41, 39, 17 and 14 year old group of people.Some of the complaints I've read is that the characters move to slow.  You can compare this game to Indiana Jones who moves at a much slower rate yet people loved that game.  Other complaints are the inventory button, again you can compare this to the Indiana Jones game.  Another complaint I read was that the lifeline indicator for a bad guy popped up ahead of time in the first game to give you warning.  Well, it doesn't do that in this one but you can hear the enemy growling or talking before he shows up and also the controller vibrates to give you warning.  I agree that the voices of Willow and Anya are off but all the other voices are great.  Yes, this is not the first game and it's camera isn't as great but there are some very redeeming qualities to this game as well.  I just don't think it is fair to rip it apart because it isn't the exact same thing as the first game.  Another interesting thing I discovered after playing this game.  I went back to play the first one and found a whole bunch of stuff to pick at that I didn't notice at first!!  The characters now seemed to move at too fast a speed as did the enemies and it was difficult fighting them!!  I also missed the easy \"stake\" access button that the new game incorporates.  My point is, you get used to what your playing and what you know and every game should be given a chance and not be played partly through.  I finished the whole game and it was a lot of fun!  For those of you who do need some help there's many game websites out there that have walkthroughs and hints from other players.  Here's a link to one of them:[website]So rent it if you must first but just give it a chance and play enough of it to get used to the different camera and moves and you might be pleasantly surprised at how much you'll like this game!!!---My original review:I absolutely loved the first game so I was extremely excited to get this.  First thing I noticed was the camera angle and movement are not as good as the first game.  That said, I went into options and I changed all the vertical options and turned them all on.  This made a big difference but it was still not as good as the first.  But after getting into the game, I really didn't notice as much because I just learned to be more creative.  Like running further into a room and then turning around so I could see what was coming.The voice actress who plays Willow is very grating at first.  She sounds like Willow on valium and seems to speak way to slow and sounds like an airhead.  Also, the voice actress doing Anya sounds nothing like Anya and didn't even seem to try.  James Marsters, Nicholas Brendan, Amber Benson and Tony Head do a great job and so does the guy who played Ethan (he is also the actual actor from the show but I just can't think of his name right now).The game has 12 levels.  You start off as Buffy and then it will finish her part and then switch to Willow, and then so on as you go through the characters.  The story is fantastic and keeps you interested all through it.  There's a lot to offer with this version that the first version did not have.  There are bonus games that you can unlock and there are also cast interviews, outtakes and Voice Over recording sessions that are a blast to watch.  You have to unlock these as you go through the game.  The better you do the more you unlock.  Each level has a certain amount of secrets (and some are extremely hard to find - which I still haven't found all of them!).  After you finish each level it ranks you and tells you how you did, how many kills you had, how many secrets you found and your ranking such as Slayer, Professional, expert, etc.  You also have the option of going back and doing a level again if you weren't able to find all the secrets.This game needs more save points though.  There are continutation points as you go through so if you get killed you can continue from that point.  But if you want to just quit it doesn't matter where you were in that level you have to start the whole level all over again.  This is extremely frustrating because some of these levels are extremely long especially when playing them for the first time so to then have to lose all that time spent is very frustrating.  Also there are many times where you will be confused and not know what to do next (this is just not with me - I've read many a complaint on posting boards regarding this problem) and you will spend an incredible amount of time running all over the place.I would've loved to have given this game 5 stars but just couldn't do it.  The problems with the camera difficulties, the motion of the characters, and the lack of save points made the difference.  The story line is fantastic, the different levels are great, the ability to play as different characters and all the unlockable extras are a major addition that the first game didn't have (although the first games story was also very good).  This game is more detailed and has a lot more to look at and it will take you a lot longer to finish it.  Another minus is the fact that there is only one difficulty level.  The first game had Easy, Normal and Hard to chose from.  Having mastered Hard on the first one I think I had an easier time adjusting to the difficulties of this one but other people have complained about not being able to.In closing I do recommend this especially to any Buffy fan.\n",

      "After three incredibly successful games in the form of Tomb Raider, Tomb Raider 2 and Tomb Raider 3, Lara Croft returned in November 1999 with Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation. The previous two games didn't really live up to the title of 'Tomb Raider' as there weren't many tombs involved at all, but The Last Revelation takes advantage of its trademark name by putting Lara back into the tombs - where she belongs! This was the third Tomb Raider game I bought, after Tomb Raider and Tomb Raider 2, and I have to say it is one of the most exciting and enjoyable games I have ever played. The Offical PlayStation Magazine says, \"10/10 - An atmospheric, beautiful, wonderfully crafted game\". And you know what? They're absolutely right...The story of The Last Revelation is very intricate - gripping, without being too unbelievable. While exploring Egypt, Lara discovers the lost tomb of the Ancient Egyptian God, Set. He was outwitted and imprisoned in a secret tomb, and warns that he will one day return to seek vengance. Lara unwittingly unleashes its ancient evil, fulfilling the prophecy that threatens to plunge mankind into eternal darkness! In a race against time, Lara must use all her wit and skill to re-imprison Set to save the world from unspeakable evil and Armageddon! The Last Revelation begins with a flashback level from the 1980's when Lara was 16 on her first exploration in Angkor Wat, Cambodia. She is led around by her mentor, Werner Von Croy. This is really just a training level that teaches new Tomb Raider players the ropes on how to control Lara. After this, the game really begins - in the present day. We learn that on their escape from the tomb in Cambodia, Lara left Von Croy to die after the tomb began to collapse around her. It's not long, however, until we find out that Mr Von Croy is indeed alive and well, and on the look out for Lara to get revenge! The game is split into six different sections; Training Levels, Recovering the Amulet of Horus, Discovering the Truth, The Search for the Armor, The Search for Jean-Pierre and The Final Conflict. This game has been giving a rating of 11+, but I think it should be at least a 15+ because the graphics are much better than the first two games, making everything look more life like. I admit that some of the levels on this game, especially towards the end scared me to death! I used to sit there with both eyes squinted, scrwaming my head off as the sweat used to pour from my hands...pretty sad when you think about it now! Despite this, the levels are amazingly intricate and full of life and colour - much more detailed than any of the games in the series. Since the game is set entirely in Egypt, you get a real feel to what life is like over there and almost become part of the game. This game took me nine months to complete (December 1999-September 2000) and I have to say that I enjoyed every second of it! Lara has a variety of new features and you also have to go back and forth between levels to find a particular object that will open the door to the finale. The cut-scenes that run through the entire game to tell the story are absolutely mind-blowing. The graphics are brilliant - it's just like watching a film...and Lara's boobs seem to get bigger as the series goes along! The last level truly is one of the greatest, most spectacular levels in video gaming history which involves a confrontation with the God Set! In the final cut-scene of the game, Lara is seen exiting the crumbling tomb to find Von Croy at the entrance. Emotion takes over and he puts out his hand, but it's too late. The tomb collapses with Lara still inside. This really was a tense moment for Tomb Raider fanatics as they were left wondering if this was it for Lara, if there favourite compuiter game series was over for good. They need not have worried as Tomb Raider: Chronicles and Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Angel Of Darkness followed!OVERALL GRADE: 10/10All in all, Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation is a must-have game for Tomb Raider fans and for anyone who enjoys computer games in general. But be warned, this game requires a lot of time, effort and determination. If you want to get everything right on the first time, you're best off not buying this game because you'll just hate it. Yet for people who want an exciting, suspenseful, thrilling, action-packed blockbuster of a video game, Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation is the game for you! Buy it now from Amazon!\n",

I have been playing Pokemon games since they started. My first game was Pokemon Blue and I have never missed one in the series since. The joy of finding new Pokemon never seems to get old for me. SO when I learned about Pokemon X/Y I was of course Joyful as I usually was when hearing about a new Pokemon game.Nothing could prepare me for this game. Nothing.Gameplay 10/10For those new to Pokemon, You enter a world where we capture, raise, and battle with Animals known as Pokemon. They gain levels, have stats, learn different attacks and each has their own elemental Strengths and Weaknesses attached to them. Fire is weak to water, Water is weak to Grass, Grass is weak to fire etc... there are 18 I believe elements in total and all have their own Rock-Paper-Scissors Pros and Cons. This is back and of course just as fun as ever. Do you want to make a team of all bug Pokemon? Go for it! but know that you will be weak against Flying, Rock and Fire types, and yet strong against Psychic, Poison and Grass etc... Or you could have a team of various Pokemon, ready to fight against all types whenever the need arises. Building your own team has always been a highlight of the series, and with over 700... let me stop right there. SEVEN HUNDRED... different Pokemon to chose from you have a ridiculous number of monsters to chose from to form your 6 slot party. Now not all 700+ are in the game, I believe only around 4-5 hundred are to start, but you can trade Pokemon from previous games up and use them if your friends have it or you can even go back and try the old games etc... But this game has plenty of Pokemon to try out and have fun withFor those that are familiar with Pokemon , this game has everything you would ever want and much MUCH more. First off they have streamlined how leveling your Pokemon works. No longer do you have to Slowly one by one level each of your Pokemon against weak wild Pokemon and then grind more and more and more etc... Instead the game has made a few key changes to how EXP works which I shall list below.1. Any Pokemon that participates in the battle now gets 100% EXP, it no longer gives 50% to one and 50% to another. or 33% to all three etc...2. You get an EXP.Share about 1 hour into the game (After the first gym battle) And this time it is not even a held item! It sits in your inventory and as you fight, any Pokemon that participated in battle gets 100% Exp, any in your party that didn't get 50% exp. This is beyond amazing and is a fantastic way to level your low level Pokemon quickly without having to suffer from putting it in front, and switching out your Pokemon every single fight. If you don't like this feature, you can of course turn it off in the item menu. I suggest not doing so3. Catching a Pokemon still grants you EXP as if you had killed it.As a result of these new EXP changes you spend almost no time simply leveling up Pokemon and instead you will be spending your time trying to catch the Pokemon then you will simply grinding. In fact There are a few Pokemon in each area that aren't quite as common as others. For example in Route 1 there is a Zigzagoon that is harder to find than the more common Pidgey's Fletchings, and Caterpie that wander around. There always seems to be one in each area, and in an attempt to find it you naturally level up your Pokemon (Unless you are running from every battle).Now battles themselves have remained, from a mechanics standpoint, nearly untouched and that's a good thing. There has never been anything wrong with combat in Pokemon and this never needed to be changed. They did of course change the graphics and animations which I will touch on later. There are a lot of smaller, what I like to call Quality of Life Improvements, to the UI and everything that I don't see the need to go into here as if you see them you will know exactly what I mean.EV Training (Effort Values) has become much simpler this time around, you don't have to guess and check what your Pokemon's EV points are. To make along story short, EV points are how the game determines what stat bonuses a Pokemon gains. In all previous games EV points were given only by defeating Pokemon , each Pokemon gives different values. In this game, you can still do that, but you can also use training mini-games on the touch screen to raise it manually. These can get repetitive but it is a fantastic way to make sure your Pokemon get's the points in the stats you want them to be in. I spent an hour filling out my ZigZagoons speed and Attack stats so I knew it would gain the most in those 2 areas as he leveled. If you mess up or don't like how it turned out, you can actually reset EVs now using a specific item. It's been simplified for the best In my opinion as now everyone can take advantage of the EV system and in a much nicer visual way.I wanted to throw this little addition in there, for the first time in pokemon history you more or less get free movement. No longer are you permanently tied to a Grid format. Once you get the Roller Blades (About 1 hour into the game) you are able to move in full 3D movement with the joystick, you can still move in a grid format on the D-pad for precise movement. You are still limited to the grid inside of Pokemon Centers and houses, but so far that's all it's been limited too. I love this, it's a simple change but lord do I love it. Just another Quality of Life mechanic they put in.The Pokemon Aime system looked odd to me at first. It was more or less Nintendogs with Pokemon (sort of). And I kind of ignored it to begin with, But I did give it a try a little bit later and while yes it is still just a way to view and... well pet and feed your Pokemon it's also got hidden bonuses. The first is obvious, the more you pet and play with them the quicker their happiness grows. There are some Pokemon Like Riolu that will only evolve if they are happy enough. The secondary effect is it also grants another form of EXP boost. As you play and feed them their heart meter grows, granting a bonus to EXP gained as you battle, similar to if you had traded them from another trainer. I didn't learn about this until later but now that I know about it, I take time out of my farming to play with my Pokemon a bit, at least the ones I like!The last and certainly not least, new addition is the Mega Evolutions. It's a simple concept really, take an old favorite Pokemon like Mewtwo, Charizard, Blastoise etc... give them a special stone, and press a button on your magical we promise this has nothing what so ever to do with Digimon bracelets, and poof. You get a new Mega Evolution Pokemon! More or less a 4th form for some. Now these are super powerful Pokemon that can really dish out some damage, but only lasts for the one battle, and on top of that you can only have one in your party (or something like that) I am not actually far enough in the game to be able to comment much more on this, but I had to mention that it's there and I am kinda excited to try it out later.All in all, the gameplay is top notch and Fantastic.Music/Sounds 9/10I have always liked Pokemon music, this just seemed to take it to a new level. The only issue I have is that the 3DS/3DSXL's speakers don't give it justice, I hooked the system up to a speaker system in my apartment and then the music came to life, in fact more than I expected. Eery song was fantastic and fit the scene well the battle music is quick and gives an odd sense of urgency, the forest music was somewhat dark and mysterious and the town songs are nice and upbeat. My favorite song thus far is the Gym battle music which... I can't even describe but it's awesome!The sound effects are also as good as ever. Each Pokemon has their own unique Cry (Noise they make) and all Pokemon from previous games have had theirs enhanced to match the quality of the new ones. I noticed this first with Linoone as he is my favorite Pokemon so I noticed his Cry had changed since I've used him in every Pokemon game since he was introduced in Sapphire/Ruby. The battle sound effects also fit the attacks and meld perfectly in with the attack. I can hear that rock throw hitting my Linoone, and it sounds... heavy.My only minor complaint is that they didn't use the Pokemon's voices like the TV show does. The only Pokemon in the game that does is Pikachu, and I really think that they could have just made it that much better had they had all of them sound like they do in the show. It's a minor complaint but there it is!The New PokemonI didn't give this a rating because it's pure opinion, but I haven't found anything wrong with the new Pokemon. They keep coming up with some pretty awesome Ideas of new Pokemon to add... and yes some not so awesome ideas. (I don't' think I will ever forgive them for the Garbage Bag Pokemon from Black/White). I've encountered a Pokemon based on the Robin, A Panda, I've ever seen a Sword Pokemon (Ghost type). Heck my favorite Pokemon is based on a badger. All have their own personalities and it shows during combat and in the Pokemon-Aime thing. It's all a matter of what you like and what you don't like.Graphics 10/10Ok, the biggest update the game has received is to it's graphics. Up to this point, Pokemon games have been nothing but Sprites and sometimes a little movement. All your characters, sprites. All the Pokemon, slightly moving in combat sprites. They didn't have a life of their own, it felt somewhat empty... but no longer.This game, looks, FANTASTIC. One of the best looking games on the 3DS, and it doesn't suffer from poor framerate. I didn't quite realize how much effort they put into the Pokemon's Models until I started battling with them. Every Pokemon past and present has been redone with a 3D model, and I couldn't be happier. Anyone who has played any of the Pokemon stadium games will be familiar with how they look, but now we have them in the Pokemon game! Each Pokemon has their own movements and animations which is even more amazing to me. Take ZigZagoon and Linoone for example. ZigZagoon is known for moving in a ZigZag pattern, so when it attacks it does just that, running left, then right, then left, then attacking. Due to irony, when it evolves it no longer runs in zigzag patterns, it runs in a straight line but is unable to turn easily, so it's attack is no longer a zigzag, it's a straight dash at the opponent, then a jump backwards. This is just one of many examples of each Pokemon's different movements. Attacks also have their own looks and animations, some look better than others but that is to be expected. Now will they look as good as they do when fighting in the show? No, they still for the most part stay in their own battle &#34;Circles&#34; but they just look so much better when fighting I love it, I can't complain at all about it. I really can't praise the game's graphics enough... they took their time with it.Outside of battle, the game still looks amazing, the grass and tall grass still look like they used to and in a tile format, but your character and the other characters all have nice 3D models, even if you don't see them all in combat. You can change your characters clothes, get a little customization there but sadly it's limited to just a few different outfits. I suppose it's better than nothing though!Multiplayer 10/10Lets talk Multi-player. A lot of us as kids got this game and loved to trade and battle with each other, trying to have the better team, etc... But it has always been restricted in many ways. until the DS games came out, internet battling never happened. And even on the DS versions it was still limited and somewhat sluggish. Black/White added the GTS (Global Trade System) why became a great way to obtain hard to find Pokemon, or Pokemon from previous entries in the series you just didn't have the ability to get. But it was still a tad bothersome as you had to go to a specific location, or go to the Pokemon centers to activate these features.NOT ANYMORE!Pokemon X/Y said screw all that moving around, you can battle, Trade, etc... On the go! you wanna trade with a friend? Tap on his avatar on the bottom screen and say &#34;hey I wanna trade&#34; same with battling. If they accept POOF. You trade/battle right then and there. You can even do this for random passer-bys. On the bottom screen will be a constantly updating list of other random players you can challenge to battles or trade with.That not enough for ya? The GTS Is also here, and available world wide. Search for a Pokemon you want to trade for, and it will bring up a list of players that have put that Pokemon up for trade, and what they want in return. You can deposit one of your own, and ask for another Pokemon. For instance say I want a Zangoose, I can deposit a Seviper into the GTS and say &#34;I will trade this for a Zangoose&#34; if someone accepts it the trade occurs and you can pick up the Pokemon later. That's the best part about this, you don't have to sit and wait. It's all done even if your game is turned off. You merely have to check up on it later! you also don't have to Have the Pokemon on you to trade, trading anywhere allows you to access your Storage Bank of Pokemon and trade from there, this is a new feature and one i welcome with wide open arms.This time around they added 2 new features to the Multiplayer!The first is Wonder Trade. This is an... interesting New one. You trade one of your Pokemon , any one ya want, to another random person. You don't know what you are going to get until the trade is completed. And you can do this infinitely. You will probably get a lot of junk Pokemon , but I have already received some things I didn't expect. I got an Eevee, and a wierd other Pokemon I had never seen before. Along with like 3 Caterpies. But still, it's random fun. And each time you use an interaction like Wonder Trade, Trade, Battle... you gain PokeMiles which can be traded for useful items at a vendor in the main city.The other thing they added is O-powers. these are short term buffs you can give yourself or other players. Things like &#34;raise Attack, Raise Defense, Increase Capture Rate, etc...&#34; They last about 3 minutes (at least at level 1) and can be sued as long as you have.. O points I guess they are called. you recover the Points as time passes, using the ability in yourself costs the full point value and using it on a friend or other player costs 1/2 the value. It's just a fun way to help others or yourself out.Final Score:I give Pokemon X/Y, 9 Linoones and a Zigzagoon (9.5) out of 10.It's not perfect, but damn it's close. This is the Pokemon game that I have always wanted ever since the original Pokemon Stadium came out, showing off the Pokemon in 3D. I am a little sad that there isn't a version on the Console, I'm sure they will still make the Stadium U game, but Those only deal with combat, this is the whole game and I adore it. My only complaints I have are really the same complaints I have had from the start of Pokemon's Existence. I hate HMs. Always have, always will.If you are New to the Pokemon series, this is probably the best to start on, even if the start is a bit rough for new players. (They don't explain a heck of a lot it just assumes you know some things by now). But it's also the best in the entire series for experienced and casual returning players alike.\n",

      "Pokemon Silver is the newest addition to the Pokemon series. It has the same gameplay as the original and has over 100 more pokemon. This game would have gotten a higher rating if it was the only Pokemon game to come out. Unfortunately, it's similar to the other Pokemon games making it repititous. If you aren't a crazed pokemon fan then don't get it. If you are then I highly reccomend it, as it will give justice to the Pokemon phenomenon.\n",

      "Pokemon Platinum has a few parts in it that are different then Pearl and Diamond, but over all it is pretty much similar. If you are a Pokemon fan and you collect the games, I would not miss out on buying it though. A good example to use is the classic game, Pokemon Gold and Silver Version. Nintendo later made Pokemon Crystal Version. It had a few parts in the game that were different then Gold or Silver, it had a different Legendary Pokemon that the game was centered around, but over all, the game was similar. In my opinion, Pokemon Platinum was a step up than Pokemon Crystal. It actually has much more after the game that Pearl and Diamond didn't have. A few more Legendary Pokemon are now available in Platinum that were not in Pearl and Diamond too. So, if your a Pokemon game collector, or just a fan of Pokemon, I wouldn't miss out on Pokemon Platinum. It's like playing Pearl and Diamond all over again only twice more better and funner. Pokemon Platinum Version is a must have...\n",

      "A note: This review does NOT apply to Pokemon Emerald, Ruby and Sapphire's counterpart, since I have not played Pokemon Emerald.Ahh, Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire. By far some of the best games in Pokemon history so far. (Pokemon Firered in close second.)Longtime Pokemon fans with obviously enjoy this great game,(Like myself) and it will surely introduce many new fans to the series.You start out as either a male or female trainer. After a bit of talking, you discover that the town's local professor, Professor Birch, (Yes, as in a Birch tree) being cornered by a grumpy Poochyena. You grab one of the Pokemon from his bag, (A Treeko, grass type, Torchic, Fire type, or Mudkip, water type) And use it to defend the professor. That Pokemon will become your first ever Pokemon. And so, the adventure begins! (Geez, what a cliche'd line, lol.)Anyway, this game has many, many, (Insert the word 'many' a whole bunch of times ^-^) new features.First of all, a huge bundle of brand new Pokemon! And now, thanks to Pokemon Firered and leafgreen, you can get the 151 of the Kanto region in here too! Sadly, there are no new Pokemon Gold/Silver remakes...yet.Plus, there are Contests! Contests are special...well...contests, based on several categories, like Beauty, Tough, and Cute. Raise your pokemon to fit Contest form with Pokeblocks, a special candy that increases it's Coolness, Cuteness, Toughness, etc. Pokemon moves are also categorized. Such as, Bubble is a Cute move, and Brick Break is a Tough move, therefore, they can be used in their respective contests.There are also Natures, which can affect the way a Pokemon grows. Examples of Natures are: Relaxed, or Brave. Also, they affect the types of Pokeblocks a Pokemon likes.Abilities are another new feature. They are basically, special Pokemon abilities. Such as, the ability, Keen Eye. A Pokemon with the Keen Eye ability stops accuracy reduction in battle. Very, very useful!!Plus, a herd of new Pokemon moves! And, a bundle of new Pokeballs!The main Legendary Pokemon are Groudon, Kyogre, and Rayquaza. You can get Rayquaza in both games, but Groudon is only in Ruby, and Kyogre is only in Sapphire. But, if you own Pokemon Emerald, you can get all three!There are also even more Legendaries! Latios, Latias, Regirock, Registeel, Regice, Jirachi, and Deoxys.Well, that's pretty muhc all I'll tell you. I don't want to ruin any surprises. But, here are a few helpful tricks and tips:* As I have said in a Pokemon Firered reviews, DON'T Use all uber Legendaries. For one, no one will battle you, in fear of getting creamed, and second, it's not original. Nowadays, EVERYONE uses all Legendary teams in Official Competitons, and there's no variety, and no challenge to win. -_-; Not so 'Legendary' any more, huh?*CATCH SHINY POKEMON. Do I need to underline it? They are Pokemon colored differently than usual, and SUPER rare. I have not encountered one yet on my Ruby and Sapphire versions, but I have a Shiny Graveler on Firered. They are recognizable by a shimmery glow of stars around them, and their different colors. If you see one, CATCH IT!*Plant Berries! Currently, on Sapphire, I used up all the game's berries, and I can't plant many more. (I think I have the dreaded Berry Glitch) Berries are useful in battle, and are used to make Pokeblocks for Pokemon Contests.*This isn't really a tip...more of an evaluation. If you are a Newbie to Pokemon games, don't choose Torchic. It is weak to many Gym leaders, but is great for expierienced trainers. (I have a Blaziken, evolves form of Torchic, and let me tell you, it was touhg deafeatinbg Roxanne, a Rock type gym leader.) Treecko would be a better chocie, since it is strong against more Gym Leaders than the other two. Mudkip will be good for intermediate players.Well, that's all!\n",

      "Mega Man 2is generally considered the breakout game for our titular blue bomber, and for good reason: it fixed all the problems found in the firstMega Man, and was one of the best games for the NES.  Truthfully, it's the only \"Mega Man\" game I had for the NES in the late 1980s and early 1990s, though I played the first game quite a bit as well.  As good as \"Mega Man II\" is, is it really the best Mega Man game ever, let alone in the classic series?If it weren't for \"Mega Man III\", I would unequivocally say yes.  \"Mega Man III\" is easily as good as \"Mega Man II:, and opens up the Mega Man gameplay, expanding Mega Man's repertoire.Major new features introduced in \"Mega Man III\"*Slide - Mega Man can now slide, creating new possibilities for level design.*You can now carry up to 9 energy tanks, rather than 4 like \"Mega Man II\"*Due to the introduction of the Doc Robot levels, this is by far the longest of the six NES \"Mega Man\" games.*Rush, Mega Man's iconic robotic dog, makes his debut here.*Proto Man, masquarding as the mysterious Break Man, debuts as well.*Another notable feature is this is the first game that has accurate cover art on how Mega Man actually appears in the game.  \"Mega Man\" is notoriously bad cover art, and \"Mega Man II\"'s cover art has Mega Man holding a gun rather than his arm cannon.  Not bad but not great. This is definitely an improvement over the last two.\"Mega Man III\" actually has the best story of all six NES titles.  Dr. Light and Dr. Wily are working together to build a giant peace keeping robot named Gamma.  However, the eight robot masters that the two designed to help keep the peace go beserk, stealing 8 power crystals.  The two scientists quickly call Mega Man into action.Mega Man must defeat the eight bosses to regain the crystals.  This set of levels is probably my favorite in any Mega Man game.  They're all very well designed, and just flat-out fun to play.  The Shadow Man level and Snake Man level are both great.But wait, there's more.  After defeating the eight robot masters, four new levels open up (they are remixed or altnerate versions of four regular levels), and robot masters named Doc Robots are masters of these levels.  There are two Doc Robots per level.  While all the Doc Robots look the same, they are actually programmed to act like one of the robot masters in MEGA MAN II.  When you reach the Doc Robot's lair, the sprite of one of the \"Mega Man II bosses descends from top of the screen down into Doc Robot, like the spirit of that perspective boss is inhabiting or animating the Doc Robot's body.Once you defeat the 8 Doc Robot masters, another level opens in the center of the portrait page, entitled BreakMan.  It is a simple one screen level, where you must fight ProtoMan.  Ultimately, it is revealed Proto Man is Mega Man's brother, and built before Mega Man.  Proto Man, who has been kept ambigious throughout the game, has been helping train Mega Man with each fight.After you finish your training level with Proto Man, you now learn that Dr. Wily has stolen the power crystals Mega Man recovered, and has holed up in a new Skull Castle, intent on activating Gamma and reprogramming him to begin yet another attempt to take over the world via thru the campaign of bloody massacre or pogrom.Wily's Castle features several cameos or references to the first two games.*The famous Rock Monster (AKA the Yellow Devil) from the first game makes a return appearance, with a newly designed appearance.*Gamma looks a lot like Gutsman (who, of all the villains in Mega Man, makes the most cameo appearances in other games, his likeness also appears as a Wiley Castle Boss in \"Mega Man III\").*The boss guarding the transporter room in the fourth portion of Dr Wily throws rocks like Gutsman.*Mega Man must fight his clone, just like the original \"Mega Man\".  This  time around, there are three platforms, each with a separate clone.  One clone is real, the other two holograms, and the real clone's location constantly changes between the three platforms.The Dr. Wily stages are fun, although the last incarnation of Dr. Wily is the weakest of all six NES Wily bosses.  With a single top spin, you destroy him.The only two negative things I have to say about the game is this: the story is not really explained, and the inclusion of Top Man.1.  The story is the best in the NES Mega Man Games.  With the other titles, you are given some cut scenes to tell what little story there is.  In \"Mega Man III\", there are no cut scenes initially, so you don't really know the story.  In fact, until you defeat BreakMan and the Dr Wily stage opens up (the Dr Wily levels is proceeded by a cut scene with Dr. Light and Mega Man, revealing Dr Wily is evil), you probably won't even now Dr Wily is supposed to be helping you.  Granted, the game is longer than the other titles, so maybe they didn't have the memory to work with on extra cut scenes, given the NES's technical limitations.  Still, given how it's the best story it's sad Capcom relied almost entirely on the game manual, which most NES players won't have access too, to advance the story.2. Top Man.  He's the most stupid robot master of the first three games, and his weapon is hard to figure out how to use.  Once you do figure it out, its pretty useless with the sole exception of the last boss fight.  The whole idea of \"Top Man\" as a robot master is pretty ridiculous, and is the first indication in the Classic Series that Capcom is beginning to run out of ideas for robot masters.  This trend of borderline asinine robot masters would continue thru \"Mega Man IV\" and \"Mega Man 5\", and reach the absolute bottom of the barrel in \"Mega Man 6\"(really, who the HELL thought of \"Plant Man\"?)  A minor quibble, though, and don't let that distract you from all the game has to offer.  It's a more important as an indicator of bad things to come for the series than really effecting this game's quality.  Beginning cracks in the foundation, if you will.Overall, I think this is easily one of Mega Man's best games, and is an essential purchase for NES and retro gamers, as well as Mega Man fans.  As much as I like \"Mega Man II\", I really think \"Mega Man III\" gives it a run for its money.Though \"Mega Man II\" is more important from a franchise historical pov as it was his first major hit game (\"Mega Man\" was more of a sleeper hit), \"Mega Man III\" takes everything about \"Mega Man II\" and improves on it.  This one definitely ups the ante, and the next three sequels simply can't compare it its genius or playability.\n",

      "It's hard to believe, but the Mega Man series has been around for approximately 15 years. Within that time span, the core mechanics of the series have remained largely unchanged, though Capcom has admittedly attempted to deviate from the path with recent releases in the EXE series and, to a lesser extent, the Zero series. However, the latest release in the Mega Man series, Mega Man &amp; Bass, doesn't do anything drastically different to make itself stand out from other games in the series. In fact, anyone craving some old-style, surprisingly difficult Mega Man action shouldn't think twice before jumping right into Mega Man &amp; Bass. Mega Man and Bass have different skills. For those who are unaware, Mega Man &amp; Bass was one of the few Mega Man games for the Super Famicom that was never released in North America. The game lets you play as either Mega Man or his sinister-looking cohort, Bass, both of whom have different abilities that affect the way you play the game. Mega Man has all of his traditional attacks, such as his buster shot (which he can also charge up) and the slide, but Bass is a little more dynamic, with his ability to rapid-fire in any direction and to perform double jumps, a skill that becomes invaluable in later parts of the game. Both characters can absorb a boss's weapon, but unfortunately, these weapons function similarly for both Mega Man and Bass. It's also worth noting that Mega Man's default weapon is a little stronger than Bass', which is meant to compensate for Mega Man's inability to use rapid fire.Interestingly, many of the levels and even some of the boss fights in the game seem to be primarily designed for Bass and his specific skills, or at least they're a little bit easier when playing as Bass. As previously mentioned, Bass' double jump is quite useful. It helps you bypass certain obstacles--such as the annoying disappearing-reappearing block puzzles from Mega Man 2 that appear in the game--which Mega Man would have to confront head-on. Of course, Mega Man has his own advantages. He can slide into small areas that usually contain health and, in some cases, into areas that Bass cannot reach, but these aren't as abundant as you might think. Whether you're playing as Mega Man or Bass you'll find that the game, or more specifically the boss battles, can be fiendishly difficult. In most Mega Man games, you can learn the attack pattern of an individual boss and adjust your strategy accordingly, but in Mega Man &amp; Bass, the bosses have so many different attacks that it can be difficult to gauge what they're going to do next. It can be frustrating to encounter a boss only to lose all your lives and have to start over at the beginning of the level, but since the levels are relatively short, it's not a huge pain to go back through them repeatedly. The fact that the game automatically saves at certain points in a level makes this more bearable. There are a few other differences between Mega Man &amp; Bass and most of the other games in the Mega Man series. Instead of selecting any level at the beginning of the game, you'll only be able to select from three--you can select other stages after beating the first three bosses. In addition, Mega Man &amp; Bass features a shop system where you can buy power-ups for either character, including additional lives, health, or armor that reduces spike damage. Only a few of these items are truly useful, but there is quite a selection to choose from. Lastly, there's a library in the game where you can unlock information on dozens of Mega Man characters by finding CDs that are spread across each level, some of which are precariously dangled over spikes and other such hazards. As with most ports from the Super Nintendo to the Game Boy Advance, the graphics in Mega Man &amp; Bass appear to be unchanged from those in the Super Nintendo game. Most of the sprites in the game are quite large and vivid, and they animate well. Even the traditional helmet-wearing enemies from previous Mega Man games have a surprising amount of detail in their walking animation. There are also some nice little touches. When Mega Man or Bass are dangerously low on health, their idle animation will indicate that. Unfortunately, some of the backgrounds can be a little bland at times, but you'll have little time to pay attention to them anyway. These are some of the toughest bosses in any Mega Man game to date. The music in Mega Man &amp; Bass is successful in capturing the theme of each level, but there aren't any tracks that particularly stand out. The music quality also varies--some tracks sound as though they were produced on Game Boy sound hardware, while others are definitely Super Famicom quality. All of the sound effects have been reused from previous Mega Man games, particularly the noise that Mega Man and Bass make after landing a jump, which you'll hear quite often. There's nothing particularly special about Mega Man &amp; Bass other than the fact that it lets you play as two characters with different abilities that can actually make the game more difficult or less difficult. As such, if you're looking for a straightforward Mega Man action game, you really can't go wrong with Mega Man &amp; Bass, but if you're looking for a game that puts more spin on the traditional Mega Man recipe, you might want to try out the Mega Man Zero games or the Mega Man EXE games.\n",

      "Mega Man might be old, but he's one tough little midget. Back in his heyday, he ran through a gauntlet of action platformers, foiling the ever-nefarious Dr. Wily and his band of unique henchmen over and over again. Unfortunately, there was one recurring frustration with Mega Man: his adventures had become too repetitive, each new game simply a mirror of the last.In an ironic effort to keep the fading series fresh, Mega Man is constantly being re-imagined. Over the past few years, we've seen Mega Man X, Mega Man Legends, Mega Man EXE, Mega Man Zero, Mega Man Soccer, and coming soon, a Mega Man RPG. Cripes! All this for a robot-kid who didn't learn how to duck until Mega Man X5, some 20 games into the series? Rather than keep us interested, this overbearing diversity is enough to make us long for the simple action of the original games.But have heart, young gunners - Mega Man Anniversary Collection hops aboard the time travel express and offers a nostalgic trip back to the classic Mega Man games. Newcomers might not get misty-eyed, but even they can't argue with the value-minded price. The collection includes all the classic games, Mega Man 1 through Mega Man 8, plus two average fighting games never before released in the U.S.For newbies who don't know much about the series, Mega Man is a blue robot with a heart of gold. In Japan, his name was Rock Man. His sister robot was named Roll. Rock and Roll. Oh, the wit.Anyway, Mega Man repeatedly fights against Dr. Wily, a crazed inventor who fashions eight evil robots of various talents. By beating these robots, Mega Man earns their weaponry, each of which is effective against some other major baddie. Eventually, Mega Man throws down against Wily in the evil scientist's skull fortress. Wily gets whooped, promises to always be good, brush his teeth, and never again wrong the world'and five seconds later, he does it again.The good news is that there are no emulation problems in this collection - expect perfect 8-, 16- and 32-bit recreations all the way. You jump, you shoot, you gain new abilities, you jump and shoot some more. The games play just as they did originally, which means they're still hard, fun and classic.That being said, some of the games are better than others. The original Mega Man was difficult and not particularly fun, and the same holds true today. Things pick up in Mega Man 2, 3 and 4, where the series truly found its groove and defined itself as a top-notch platformer.Much of that has to do with the robots. Some of them look sharp, like the wicked Pharaoh Man and Snake Man, while others look improbably ridiculous, like the moronic Clown Man. As is usually the case with a series that has stuck around a little too long, the designs get less original and more far fetched as the years pass. The best robot designs, unsurprisingly, are in Mega Man 2, 3, and 4. With each new iteration, you can see Dr. Wily losing it more and more. Flower Man? Top Man? Wily, please.Really only a few changes have been made to the games and they're very minor. The Navi remix mode that first appeared in Mega Man 8 is now in every game, which overlays intermittent, non-invasive directional arrows to help keep you from going the wrong way. Navi mode also replaces the original 8-bit midi tracks with actual instruments. The 8-bit versions still sound more fitting, but the remixes certainly aren't a problem.A new quicksave memory card system has been grafted over the old password system, allowing easy automatic saves instead of the tedium of writing down all the grid information. Purists can still enter in the old passwords or start over if they die, however.The interface wrapping everything together is kind of neat as well; instead of a normal menu, Mega Man runs through doors marked with the various games and options. While superficially clever, much more could have been done with this. Why not a museum for Mega Man to wander through?It's a little hard to quibble about \"extras' in a collection of this size, however. Mega Man Anniversary Collection does include plenty of art and audio to unlock as well as the two unreleased fighting games, both of which are pretty bad. The PS2 also enjoys a Mega Man cartoon episode.For $30, there's no cheaper way to re-experience Capcom's mega-past. Though the series is pretty much stale these days, that wasn't always the case, and the Mega Man Anniversary Collection serves as a reminder that while the games might feel a little dated, the Blue Bomber still has some fight left.\n",

      "By the time Capcom released MEGA MAN VI on the NES, it was obvious to all in the industry that Nintendo's 8-Bit console, the machine that resurrected the video game market in the mid 1980s to the multibillion dollar industry that it is now, was on its last legs.  Capcom wanted to move Mega Man to the SNES, but before doing so, they made a final chapter for everyone's favorite blue bomber.Ironically enough, Capcom chose not to release MEGA MAN VI in the United States, publishing the game only in Japan, due to their decision to put their efforts behind the new MEGA MAN X series.  When Capcom informed Nintendo of this decision, Nintendo took it upon themselves to publish the game in America, which is why the game was never released in Europe.How does it stand up to the other five games?  Actually, not that bad.  It's obvious Capcom is running out of ideas.  The basic story is that a mysterious Mr. X (gee, I wonder who that could be) has been setting up a robot tournament, and when Mega Man shows up, all the robots turn against Mega Man and Mr X tries to take over the world.  Naturally, when you defeat Mr X, turns out it is Dr. Wiley and you have to go into a second castle.  While Mega Man IV and V at least at an element of surprise in their \"twist\" ending, by VI you can tell it's Wiley from the beginning, even kinda looks like him.First off, the graphics are top notch, and so is the sound.  But that is little surprise as Mega Man always had great graphics for the NES.Capcom was so bereft of ideas They even had contestant winners in Nintendo Power design two of the robot bosses (Wind Man, designed by Michael Leader of the US, and Knight Man, designed by Daniel Vallie of Canada).The other six bosses are largely retreads of previous robot masters or just plain ridiculous.We have Plant Man (who, might I add, is the single worst boss in not only Mega Man, but in all of video games - he's just gay).  His (lame) weapon is a flower shield, and basically he's a poor boy version of the superior Leaf Man from MEGA MAN II.  We have Blizzard Man, who for whatever reason is on skis.  Ripoff of Air Man from II and Ice Man from the first game.  Flame Man is yet another heat-based robot master (we've already had Fire Man from I, Heat Man from II, and Napalm Man from V).  We have Tomahawk Man, who is very formidable, but still feels out of place and like Capcom was really stretching for ideas.  Centaur Man is at least somewhat imaginative. The worst, though, is Yamato Man.  Apparently Yamato is a geographical term in Japan.  It'd be like Oxford Man or Birmingshire Man or Las Vegas Man.  Incomprehensible.  Stupid.  Even Wind Man, who was designed by one of the contestant winners, is little more than another version of Air Man.The levels themselves, while compentant, are hardly what you call inspired.  A lot of them you have seen before in previous incarnations, especially Flame Man's level (come on, we've had fire-themed levels before).A bad part of the levels is that four of them have false endings, I guess in attempts from Capcom to give the game more replayability. In each of the levels for Tomahawk Man, Yamato Man, Knight Man, and Centaur Man, two separate boss chambers appear, one more difficult to reach than the other.  By accessing the more difficult of the two you get one of four letters (B, E, A, T), and when you get all four you can now use Beat, the robotic bird from Mega Man V.  Quite frankly, the fake endings are rather dumb.The last levels have some engaging moments, even though one of the castle bosses (a big dragon) is a little too similar too the boss dragon of Mega Man II for my comfort.  There's another stage in the Wiley's castle which is primarily dirty water and those spiked orbs, which is again a throw back to Mega Man II.The end features Dr Wiley being thrown in jail, with the last words and a newspaper picture printed.  The ending provides good closure for the series, but then Capcom spoils that by saying \"To be continued\".  Still a good way to close the NES leg of Mega Man's journey as far as story-wise goes.Mega Man also has some new features.  Taking a page from Mario, he has a rush adapter that allows him to fly (albeit, pretty briefly).  This is featured prominently on the game art.  Beat returns.  I would like to have flown longer, given how much this was hyped.Is MEGA MAN VI a good game? Yes.  Without a doubt.  It would be an even better game its five predecessors did not exist.  Because ultimately, even though they tried adding some new things to the Mega Man formula, at the end of the day, Capcom with this title feels tired and uninspired, like they trying to squeeze one more dollar out of the Mega Man franchise.  But that's largely because MEGA MAN VI is just more of the same.  If you like the formula you'll love this title.  But it is still very formulaic.All the NES Mega Man games are good, but they're largely the same.  I'd go with II or III first, but if you haven't played any Mega Man games VI is a good place to start.  But II and III should be your first choice.\n",

      "In the late 80's, Nintendo ruled the world with its NES. Countless games had been released and created many memories for gamers around the world. The Mega Man series were running full steam thanks to the underground buzz of Mega Man and the breakout success of Mega Man 2. Revered for the classic shoot and jump game play, memorable Robot Masters and awesome music, the games were a joy to play through and Capcom had to keep up with the demand for more Mega Man games. After releasing a Mega Man title for the Game Boy, they headed back to the drawing board for 1990's Mega Man 3. It was at that point that many felt (including myself) the NES Mega Man series reached the highest point.The story for Mega Man 3 goes like this: After being defeated twice, Dr. Wily decides to be a good guy and help Dr. Light create a new peace keeping robot for their world. In order for it to be fully powered, they send Mega Man to get energy crystals. Just as he leaves for his journey, robots go crazy and threaten to halt the introduction of the new robot. Now, Mega Man had to get the energy crystals and find out why the robots went crazy. Of course, in the end, Dr. Wily was behind the commotion and stole the robot so he can use it to take over the world. Surely, Mega Man stopped him......and found out that he had a brother, Proto Man.The premise of Mega Man 3 is the same as the previous two entries: Choose one stage out of eight stages filled with enemies and a Robot Master. Get the special weapons from all Robot Masters by completing all eight stages. Next, you moved on to the next set of stages (four \"Doc Robot\" levels where you face off against robots \"possessed\" by the spirits of the Robot Masters from Mega Man 2.) Finally, after you clear one extra stage, you reach Dr. Wily's castle and this time it was made up of six stages. By the time you beat the game, you would have played through 19 stages, the most in a Mega Man game out of the entire NES series. There were new additions first introduced to the NES Mega Man series: the ability to slide through narrow gaps between walls, Mega Man's new sidekick (Rush the robot dog) who came with his own adapters that transformed him into various objects, the ability to save up to nine energy tanks and Proto Man, Mega Man's brother who first appeared in disguise as Break Man to test Mega Man. The password system returned to help save your progress so you can continue your game later.The PROS: Mega Man 3 perfected everything that the Mega Man games were known for: a good story, excellent graphics, superb music, good sound effects, perfect controls and a difficulty level that wasn't too easy nor was it too overbearing. Capcom hit all the right notes with new Robot Masters (for the first time one of them was based on an animal, portraying a hint of what has yet to come), new stage layouts, appearances from Mega Man 2's Robot Masters, new abilities, new characters and the longest Mega Man game to grace the NES.The CONS: While it was mentioned in the story, you never ever picked up the energy crystals so it was kind of weird. Some gamers noticed that with this game, the Robot Masters were more prone to receive damage because they didn't have a grace period between hits. This was weird to see but it was just a small fraction against the game since you still had to memorize the robot's attack pattern and avoid touching it.Many gamers agreed that Mega Man 3 was another fun game to play starring the Blue Bomber. It sold very well and ensured that we would see him again. There are good reasons that Mega Man 3 in particular was and is still fondly remembered. All you have to do is play the game. For Mega Man fans, it was awesome. If you weren't a fan by the time it was released, then this game wouldn't sway your opinion. For those who missed out on any of the NES games, you did miss out. Get yourself a copy of this game through any of these methods: the actual cartridge, the Mega Man Anniversary Collection disk (PS2 or GC) or download this game for the Wii from the Virtual Console Cartridge for US $5.00 (500 points.) Any way you choose is worth it. I highly recommend it.\n",

This varies from a snowy mountain, to a serene cabin in the woods, to a beachfront paradise.  Everything an over-worked, underpaid Sim could dream of!ALso included are DOZENS of cool new items that your Sims can play with while on vacation.  The boardwalk at the beach includes several games your Sims can play to earn tokens.  With those tokens, they can get all sorts of Sim junk!  And another new addition is a shelf your Sims can put their junk on when they get home so they can always remember their special trip to the beach.The more frigid Sims can enjoy snowboarding or have a good old-fashioned snowball showdown.  For those Sims who want to relax, there are new hot tubs to play with as well.  Also, your Sims can rent metal detectors and search for buried treasure.. who knows what the other Sims might have dropped in the snow during their mad rush to the buffet!If your Sim prefers roughing it, they can pitch a tent in the mountains and spend all day fishing.

      "The inherent problem with Sims games, I've found, is that while it has wide-ranging appeal, it has limited real gameplay opportunities.  The wonder and humor and fun times to be had with The Sims quickly gave way to the realization that this was a very realistic \"real life\" simulator, as your Sim's daily schedule included working every day for most of the day, then cooking dinner, taking care of themselves, and sleeping.  You could always cheat, make them a millionaire, never work, and play around.Then what?  After a real life week or less, maybe even longer, you've basically just got a bunch of sims you order to walk around, eat, clean, watch them work out or read to build up skills, and watch them do stuff that you should probably be doing in real life.The Sims 2 changed that to a small degree, adding a vast amount of new features, as well as a vastly improved Create a Sim feature, and unleashing a modding community with downloadable content capable of creating the absolute most realistic Sims of any Sim game ever.The switchover from The Sims to The Sims 2 was like the switch from VHS to DVD.The switchover from The Sims 2 to The Sims 3 is like the switch from DVD to Blu Ray.So to start, the good:- The Sims' base look is far better than the disgusting long-headed creatures from The Sims 2.  You can also customize aspects that were previously only doable via modding, such as hair color for any hair style, regardless of what type it is, and adjusting realistic muscle mass that actually shows, realistic fat, and while female breast size is still unrealistically small, they still show a lot more if your character has more fat than muscle.- The graphics are cleaner and far less demanding with loading screens than The Sims 2.  Things load faster.- More stuff, more options, more base-game changes and additions.The bad:- The CAS system has several fundamental flaws---much of the Sims' face is customizable, but a great many parts aren't.  Most notably---the neck.  The base Sim neck is disgustingly thick even for females, and there is absolutely no way to adjust this at all.  None.  So my petite little female Sim has the neck of a teenage football player.  There is also no way to adjust the size of the eyes or color of the lips.  You can pretty much adjust absolutely nothing except the face, and whether your sim is fat or thin or muscular.  You cannot adjust any parts of the body at all.- The CAS system is revamped in a dense and almost incomprehensible way where \"extras\" and \"advanced\" functions are hidden behind buttons that don't look like buttons, meaning I had no idea that certain hairstyles such as ponytails and the like are hidden away from the main hair selection, because it's considered \"hair with accessories\".- Initial gameplay is pretty much just the same as The Sims 2.  There's very little real change so much as it just feels as though they made The Sims 2 again with a different game engine.- The entire neighborhood is alive, regardless of whether you're there or not.  Some people would probably like this idea, but I don't think they would enjoy it very much to play as one family then discover some time later that one of their favorite families all died in a fire while they were busy playing with another creation.  It's also a hassle to get out of playing in one household to get into anotherRe-starting from the start!  With this new release, what does EA get to do?Re-release everything they did with The Sims and The Sims 2 expansion packs!It's been a trend in Sim history.  Just look back: The Sims had \"Vacation\", The Sims 2 had \"Bon Voyage\".  The Sims had \"Unleashed\", The Sims 2 had the far less creatively named, \"Pets\".  The Sims had \"House Party\" and \"Hot Date\", The Sims 2 had \"Nightlife\".And now The Sims 3 re-plays that process by which The Sims had seven expansion packs, and The Sims 2 had eight expansion packs AND ten \"stuff\" packs, none of which were free, starting with a sparse base game, and getting people to buy up the dozen expansion packs to add more stuff.  More of the same, if you've already been suckered into buying the expansion packs for the first two games.I am completely and utterly sure that The Sims 3 will feature \"re-re-releases\" of the exact same \"new\" features with more and more expansion packs for the new game.And yet you could load up your Sims 2 and all its expansion packs and have virtually the same game.  Just like with DVD and Blu-Ray, obviously The Sims 3 (Blu Ray) is better looking and is different and more updated, The Sims 2 (DVD) still has all the same features.  Almost nothing has changed.  It's more of the same.\n",

      "I have had this game since June 5th and have had over 30 hours of game play since then. If you are expecting The Sims 3 to be a beefed up version of TS2 you will be disappointed - while there are some similarities The Sims 3 is really a new game in its own right, with almost entirely new game play. It took some getting used to, to be honest.The Sims look different, although not as dramatically different as I was expecting. There are now some beautiful custom hairs you can get from sites like Peggy Sims and Mod The Sims as well as custom skins that will allow you to make Sims that look very similar to the ones from TS2. You can make more adjustments to your Sims looks since there are now body sliders that allow you to adjust the build of your Sim, as well as sliders that allow you to make adjustments to almost every aspect of your Sims' face, from the size of his ears to the shape of his jawline. Obese Sims are actually obese and not just sort of chubby like they were is Sims 2. The weight gain and/or weight loss of the Sims is also more gradual and actually requires hard work - it seems that jogging is the best way for a large Sim to drop weight and if they drop the healthier lifestyle as soon as they lose the weight, they will gradually get fat again. Other things you can pick include the pitch of your Sims voice, their favorites (favorite color, music and food) and, arguably the best new aspect of creating a Sim, their traits.Your Sims traits determine how they interact with other Sims and how well or how quickly they can climb the ranks in their chosen profession. For instance a Sim with the Evil trait will do very well in the Criminal career track while a Sim with the Genius trait will do best in the Medical career track. Your Sim will also get special actions that specifically pertain to his/her traits - a Sim who is a Mooch is able to mooch food and large or small amounts of money or a Sim who is a Daredevil will be able to do the \"Watch This!\" interaction, where they scoop some dirt off the ground and eat it. Daredevil Sims can also challenge other Sims to a breath holding contest in the pool.Traits affect your Sims behavior as well....a Coach Potato will enjoy watching TV immensely and will want to sleep longer (so get them to bed early!), while a Grumpy Sim gets angry easily or an Insane Sim will talk to himself. Evil Sims will enjoy trolling forums (ha!) or stealing candy from a baby and absent-minded Sims will often stop what they are dong and just stand there because, well, they forgot what they were doing. Traits add more variety to the game and allow you to have Sims who are truly individuals.You can no longer buy clothes, instead you just send your Sim to the dresser and you can pick their outfit. There is a color wheel and a bunch of designs to choose from so you can customize your Sims outfit. The color wheel also allows you to customize your Sims hair color and you can give them highlights if you want.Careers work differently - now instead of having to have a million friends and maxing out all your skills to get to the top of your career, you can get promoted and even earn raises just from going to work in a good mood and working hard. You will get promoted faster if you have the skills needed for your job and if you have a good relationship with your co-workers but it isn't necessary.  You can also accept opportunities, which are little tasks that pop up from time to time, to earn a boost to your job performance. Once you have reached the top of your chosen career you can still earn raises or do extra things for more cash, like perform concerts if you are a Rock Star or hold autograph signings if you are a top athlete in the Sports career.And of course there is the new seamless neighborhood which really is a great thing. You can go anywhere you want in town - anywhere. Your Sim will go by cab, bike or car. Child and teen Sims have a 10 PM curfew and if they are not home by then a cop may pick them up...I'm not sure but I think the cop will take the child to the police station and the child has to stay there for a little bit. I haven't had it happen in my game yet. There is a graveyard you can visit where you can explore the catacombs or befriend some of the ghosts (and make ghost babies!). There are parks where you can meet new people or if you have some musical talent you can play guitar for tips. There is a grocery store where you can buy food, sell your own homegrown produce or fish you have caught and a bookstore where you can buy and sell books. There is a theater where you can send your Sim to watch a movie by himself or with a friend and even a spa, where you can send your Sims for a nice relaxing massage or body treatment or even a manicure.I haven't begun to touch on all of the new things you can do in The Sims 3 - I gave it 4 stars because I'm not as addicted to this game as I expected to be after a month but it is alot of fun and a great game. Just don't expect it to be like an extension of The Sims 2.\n",

      "I bought the University expansion pack for myself this past Christmas when all the Sims 2 expansion sets were on sell for $15. It is the first expansion that came out for The Sims 2 and I like that the concept - sending your teen Sims to college - was unique to the Sims 1, instead of a rehash.First, the things I liked about this pack: Once your Sim graduates University they really begin reaping the benefits. They still start off with 20,000 Simoleans when they move back to the neighborhood but they have four new higher paying, albeit challenging, careers to choose from and on top of that, they get a larger starting pay with the other careers, like Law Enforcement or Athletic. To me, that is one of the best things about this expansion pack because I love my Sims to be rich, the richer the better. This bonus allows your Sims to begin accumulating money and living the high life much sooner (for those of us who play without money cheats anyway ;)). I also like how you get to lock two wants, once your Sim has become a senior at college. Once your Sim is a junior, he/she earns two extra want slots, giving them a total of 5, which is also awesome. And of course I love how my Sims can now buy cell phones - welcome to the 21st century! They can buy an MP3 player and a handheld game too and if there is another Sim in the house or dorm that has a handheld game you can play together over a LAN or something like that. I've only tried it once and really didn't find it very interesting but it fills the fun bar quickly.Now for the cons: the big doozy, one that many other reviewers have already talked about, is that sending your Sim to University and getting them through all 4 years takes a very, very long time. It became incredibly tedious for me after I graduated my first Sim a couple days after I bought the expansion pack. The semesters are 72 hours and there are two semesters for each year (Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior). At the end of each semester, so every 72 hours, your Sims has to take a final exam. You have a grade meter that you can fill up to the top and if it is filled, your Sim will earn an 4.0 GPA. If it's not full your Sim's GPA will drop. You can fill the meter by doing assigments, writing your term paper (Sims hate this and their fun meters will drop FAST while working on it), going to class or by making friends with your professors. You can also do research with books from the bookshelf and you have the option to do group research with another Sim in the area by clicking on them and asking them to join. Research fills the grade meter very slowly so I rarely bother with it unless I need to just top of my grade meter before the final exam. Your Sims can make friends, join a frat house (good luck with that), streak, get in fights, live off of nothing but pizza, whatever you want for the entire 4 years. But OMG it is boring. You'll have to read a book or something while playing this part of the expansion. I ended up downloading a mod that shortens the semesters to 36 hours because I was sending teens to college and then refusing to play them.The other con is minor - I don't like that your Sim doesn't get to keep the money earned from school when they go back home. Sims can earn money by doing little jobs like working in the cafeteria but let me tell you, they make so little doing that so don't even bother. Just make them paint or tutor other Sims for Simoleans. You get $50 Simoleans for every Sim your tutor and that can add up fast. Each final exam your Sim passes nets him some money as well, from $500 to $1200 in school grants depending on what his grade is. When your Sim graduates and leaves school, he doesn't get to take any of that money with him. He still starts over with $20,000. You can then move the Sim back into the family home or you can find him his own place.You do get to keep your University interactions but really, are you just going to break into a school cheer for no reason? Or streak? (I can see how that may be fun though...) The new interactions that I like are available to everyone in the game, like the option to have your Sims \"hang out\", which just means they will sit and talk until you cancel out the action. This is an excellent way to boost your friend count because while your Sim is yapping away you can tend to other members of the household. Other new interactions are pillow fighting and playing kicky ball.This expansion was worth $15 definitely. I gave it three stars because the whole University aspect, while definitely a great idea, just takes too flipping long. If EA shortened the semesters to 36 hours or even 40 hours, it would make the game so much more enjoyable.\n",

      "\n",
      "Gambling is hugely popular, especially with tech-savvy criminals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many extortionists are targeting net-based betting firms and threatening to cripple their websites with deluges of data unless a ransom is paid. But now deep defences are being put in place by some of the UK's biggest net firms to stop these attacks. Increasing numbers of attacks and the huge amounts of data being used to try to bump a site off the web are prompting firms to adopt the measures. \"Net firms are realising that it's not just about anti-virus and firewalls,\" said Paul King, chief security architect at Cisco. \"There are more things that can be done in the network to protect data centres.\" Mr King said the only way to properly combat these so-called Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks was with intelligent net-based systems. Many of the gambling sites suffering DDoS attacks are in offshore data and hosting centres, so any large scale data flood could knock out access to many more sites than just the one the criminals were targeting, said Mr King. This overspill effect was only likely to grow as attacks grow in size and scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Malcolm Seagrave, security expert at Energis, said the most common types of attacks hit sites with 10 megabytes of data over short periods of time. Bigger attacks sending down 200 megabytes of traffic or more were rarely seen, he said. \"It does feel like they are turning the dial because you see this traffic gradually growing,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "So far there have been no attacks involving gigabytes of data, said Mr Seagrave. However, he added that it was only a matter of time before such large attacks were mounted. Maria Capella, spokeswoman for net provider Pipex, said that when DDoS attacks were at their height, customers were getting hit every four to five days. The defences being put in place constantly monitor the streams of data flowing across networks and pluck out the traffic destined for target sites. \"It's about understanding what's genuine traffic and keeping attack traffic from going to the site,\" she said. \"We study the profile of their traffic and as soon as we see an anomaly in the profile that's when we start to get the backbone engineering boys to see if we are going to sustain an attack,\" said Ms Capella. This traffic can be hard to spot because DDoS attacks typically use thousands of computers in many different countries, each participating machine only sends a small part of the entire data flood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Typically these computers have been infected by a virus or worm which reports its success and the net address of compromised machines back to the malicious hacker or hi-tech criminal that set off the virus. Hijacked computers are known as zombies or 'bots and collections of them are called 'bot nets. Many spammers rent out 'bot nets to help them anonymously send junk mail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the zombies are based outside the country that hosts the target site so getting the attacking PCs shut off can be difficult. Often Pipex and other net suppliers do get advance notice that an attack is about to happen. \"The serious players tend to precede an attack with some kind of ransom e-mail,\" said Ms Capella. \"We ask, as part of the service we provide, that customers notify us of anything they have in advance that would give us forewarning.\" Once an attack is spotted dedicated net hardware takes over to remove the attack traffic and ensure that sites stay up. Energis took a similar approach, said Mr Seagrave. \"We have technology out there that allows us to detect attacks in minutes rather than let network engineers spend hours pulling the information together,\" said Mr Seagrave. Also net firms were starting to work more closely together on the problem of DDoS attacks and pool information about where they are coming from. Information gathered on attacks and where they originated has led to some arrests. He said Energis also did its own intelligence work to get in insight into which sites criminal gangs plan to target. \"We have people in places where they shouldn't be, monitoring tech sites,\" he said. Sometimes though, he said, spotting the next victim was easy. \"You can see them going alphabetically through the list with the gambling sites, trying one after another,\" said Mr Seagrave.\n",

      "\n",
      "Ask Jeeves has bought the Bloglines website to improve the way it handles content from web journals or blogs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bloglines site has become hugely popular as it gives users one place in which to read, search and share all the blogs they are interested in. Ask Jeeves said it was not planning to change Bloglines but would use the 300 million articles it has archived to round out its index of the web. How much Ask Jeeves paid for Bloglines was not revealed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bloglines has become popular because it lets users build a list of the blogs they want to follow without having to visit each journal site individually. To do this it makes use of a technology known as Really Simple Syndication (RSS) that many blogs have adopted to let other sites know when new entries are made on their journals. The acquisition follows similar moves by other search sites. Google acquired Pyra Labs, makers of the Blogger software, in 2003. In 2004 MSN introduced its own blog system and Yahoo has tweaked its technology to do a better job of handling blog entries. Jim Lanzone, vice president of search properties at Ask Jeeves in the US, said it did not acquire Bloglines just to get a foothold in the blog publishing world. He said Ask Jeeves was much more interested in helping people find information they were looking for rather than helping them write it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The universe of readers is vastly larger than the universe of writers,\" he said. Mr Lanzone said the acquisition would sit well with Ask's My Jeeves service which lets people customise their own web experience and build up a personal collection of useful links. \"Search engines are about discovering information for the first time and RSS is the ideal way to keep track of and monitor those sites,\" he said. It would also help drive information and entries from blogs to the portals that Ask Jeeves operates. There would be no instant sweeping changes to Bloglines, said Mr Lanzone. \"Our intent is to take our time to figure out the right business model not to try to monetise it right away,\" he said. Though Mr Lanzone added that Ask Jeeves would be helping organise the database of 300m blog entries Bloglines holds with its own net indexing technology. \"Being able to search the blogosphere as one corpus of information will be very useful in its own right,\" said Mr Lanzone. Rumours about the acquisition were broken by the Napsterization weblog which said it got the hint from Ask Jeeves insiders.\n",

      "Toxic web links help virus spread\n",
      "\n",
      "Virus writers have begun using the power of the web to spread their malicious wares.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Windows virus called Bofra is turning infected machines into distributors of its malicious code. Those clicking on the poisoned links in e-mail messages sent out by infected machines may fall victim to the virus. The trick is being used to prevent the progam being caught by anti-virus software that combs through code contained in e-mail attachments.\n",
      "\n",
      "The virus that uses this trick is called Bofra and the first member of the family of worms appeared on 10 November. They exploit a Windows vulnerability that was discovered only a few days earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like many other recent viruses, Bofra plunders the address book in Microsoft Outlook for e-mail addresses and scours other files on an infected machine for fresh target addresses. The virus uses its own mail sending software to despatch e-mail messages to potential victims but, unlike many other recent viruses, does not itself travel via mail. Instead the body of the mail messages sent out contain fake weblinks that, when clicked on, connect back to the machine that distributed that e-mail. Essentially, Bofra turns infected machines into small web servers that happily dole out copies of the virus. The messages try to trick people into clicking on the links by promising pornographic videos and images or by posing as payment confirmation for a Paypal transaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Copies of the messages seen by the BBC News website had bright yellow and green backgrounds. Those clicking on the links will inadvertently download the Bofra virus which will then start searching for new addresses to send itself to. Filtering firm Clearswift said this tactic of creating thousands of mini web servers was designed to help the virus spread quickly and avoid attempts to shut it down. In the past other malicious programs have relied on a single web server that downloads viral code to target machines. Shutting down this central server usually stops the virus spreading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearswift said that fact that no viral code travels in the e-mail messages sent out by machines infected by Bofra could hamper effects to limit its spread. Finnish anti-virus firm F-Secure said that, so far, it had not seen many copies of the Bofra virus and its variants in circulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tim Warner, spokesman for anti-virus firm Finjan, said: \"You have people getting very creative now to deliver the virus and get it propagating.\" Mr Warner said organisations needed to prepare deep defences to keep out the modern form of malicious mobile code. \"Most firms have secured their e-mail gateway,\" said Mr Warner, \"but the irony is that most of them let malicious content through the web gateways.\" He said behavioural systems that monitor what users do can help to spot when viruses have penetrated organisations and have started hunting for other victims. The Bofra family of viruses, which were originally thought to be offshoots of the MyDoom bug, can infect machines running Windows 2000, 95, 98, Me, NT, XP and Server 2003. Users running Windows XP that have applied the SP2 update are not vulnerable to the loophole that Bofra exploits.\n",

      "\n",
      "Viruses, trojans and other malicious programs sent on to the net to catch you out are undergoing a subtle change.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shift is happening as tech savvy criminals turn to technology to help them con people out of cash, steal valuable data or take over home PCs. Viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are getting rarer. Instead programs are now crafted for directly criminal ends and firms are tightening up networks with defences to combat the new wave of malicious code.\n",
      "\n",
      "The growing criminal use of malware has meant the end of the neat categorisation of different sorts of viruses and malicious programs. Before now it has been broadly possible to name and categorise viruses by the method they use to spread and how they infect machines. But many of the viruses written by criminals roll lots of technical tricks together into one nasty package.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You cannot put them in to the neat little box that you used to,\" said Pete Simpson, head of the threat laboratory at security firm Clearswift. Now viruses are just as likely to spread by themselves like worms, or to exploit loopholes in browsers or hide in e-mail message attachments. \"It's about outright criminality now,\" said Mr Simpson, explaining why this change has come about. He said many of the criminal programs came from Eastern Europe where cash-rich organised gangs can find a ready supply of technical experts that will crank out code to order. Former virus writer Marek Strihavka, aka Benny from the 29A virus writing group, recently quit the malware scene partly because it was being taken over by spyware writers, phishing gangs, and spammers who are more interested in money rather than the technology. No longer do virus writers produce programs to show off their technical prowess to rivals in the underground world of malware authors. Not least, said Paul King, principal security consultant at Cisco, because the defences against such attacks are so common. \"In many ways the least likely way to do it is e-mail because most of us have got anti-virus and firewalls now,\" he said. Few of the malicious programs written by hi-tech thieves are cleverly written, many are much more pragmatic and use tried and tested techniques to infect machines or to trick users into installing a program or handing over important data. \"If you think of criminals they do not do clever,\" said Mr King, \"they just do what works.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As the tactics used by malicious programs change, said Mr King, so many firms were changing the way they defend themselves. Now many scan machines that connect to the corporate networks to ensure they have not been compromised while off the core network.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many will not let a machine connect and a worker get on with their job before the latest patches and settings have been uploaded. As well as using different tactics, criminals also use technology for reasons that are much more transparent. \"The main motivation now is money,\" said Gary Stowell, spokesman for St Bernard software. Mr Stowell said organised crime gangs were turning to computer crime because the risks of being caught were low and the rates of return were very high. With almost any phishing or spyware attack, criminals are guaranteed to catch some people out and have the contacts to exploit what they recover. So-called spyware was proving very popular with criminals because it allowed them to take over machines for their own ends, to steal key data from users or to hijack web browsing sessions to point people at particular sites. In some cases spyware was being written that searched for rival malicious programs on PCs it infects and then trying to erase them so it has sole ownership of that machine.\n",

      "\n",
      "Owners of some Nokia smartphones are being warned to watch out for malicious wallpaper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those downloading the software could find all the icons on their 7610 phone swapped for images of skulls. When installed the malicious program also locks many of the 7610's functions making it hard to use and harder to repair. The program is only the latest in a series of viruses produced to attack mobile phones.\n",
      "\n",
      "The file, nicknamed Skulls, is thought to have surfaced on shareware sites where people can pick up free add-ons, such as wallpaper, games and ringtones, for their phones Symbian said that it was not sure if the damage Skulls does was intentional or simply a result of bad programming. Soon after being discovered the file is thought to have been removed from the sites that were unwittingly harbouring it. The program is masquerading as software that creates new background images and themes for the main screen of the 7610 phone. The Skulls program is labelled as a file called: 7610.extended.theme.manager.zip.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once installed the program replaces all the icons on the main page with skulls and replaces all the working applications, such as contacts, calendar, notebook etc with non-working versions so the phone becomes almost useless. The only thing the phone can do is make and take calls. A statement by Symbian played down the significance of the malicious program and said few people would fall victim to it as users have to go through several steps to install it, one of which includes ignoring a security warning. Symbian said that the spread of the Skulls program was likely to be limited as the program cannot travel from one phone to another by itself. Despite this Finnish anti-virus lab F-Secure said it had sporadic reports of 7610 owners being caught out by it. The firm has produced guidance for users caught out to help them remove the program and get their phone working again. The Skulls program is thought to have been written by a malicious hacker using the alias Tee-222. Symbian phones produced by Sony Ericsson, Motorola, BenQ, Arima and Fujitsu are unaffected by the Skulls program.\n",

      "\n",
      "Public trust in taxes is breaking down because Labour and Tories are not being straight with people on the issue, Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy has said.\n",
      "\n",
      "A day ahead of the government's pre-Budget report, Mr Kennedy used a speech to say his party was facing up to \"painful economic realities\". He said the current level of taxation was about right, although he would put a new 50% tax on top earners. Other parties have accused the Lib Dems of making uncosted promises. Mr Kennedy made it clear he was determined to counter that accusation. The Lib Dems have already published what they say are the full costings for all their plans and Wednesday's speech did not announce new policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking at the Commonwealth Club, Mr Kennedy said it was critical for a political party to have economic credibility, both on what it promised and what it was expected to deliver. He said. \"Budgets have to add up. Tough choices are needed in public spending.\" The Lib Dems would cut \"low priority\" spending, including the government's ID cards scheme and the Child Trust Fund.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those cutbacks would free up funds for increasing basic state pensions for over-75s, putting more police on the streets and reintroducing fee eye and dental checks, he said. The Lib Dems argue they were honest about taxes in the past by calling for a 1p rise on income tax. Now they say the only simple tax rise they want is a new 50% tax band for top earners to pay for scrapping university tuition fees, providing free personal care for elderly and disabled people and keeping local taxes down. There would also be a local income tax to replace council tax and a number of changes to environmental taxes to ensure it is the \"polluter who pays\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lib Dems say the Tories have only laid out possible options for cutting taxes to grab headlines while Labour has hidden most of its tax rises. Mr Kennedy said: \"That contract with the people - that the government will only tax fairly and will spend their money wisely - can only be sustained if the political parties are straightforward about their plans. \"With the stealth tax strategy of Gordon Brown, the obvious unfairness of our current tax system - especially the council tax, and the empty promises of the Conservative party on this issue - it is no wonder that trust in taxation is breaking down.\" He challenged the Treasury to open up its books so the National Audit Office can report on the government's performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conservative co-chairman Liam Fox said: Liam Fox said \"If Charles Kennedy is serious about making his budgets add up he should start by explaining how they would fund their 100 spending commitments. \"The reality is, the Lib Dems lack the courage to tackle waste and bureaucracy, and the only people who would face 'tough choices' would be the families who would be £630 worse off a year. \" And Chancellor Gordon Brown said the Lib Dem figures did not add up.

      "\n",
      "The chancellor said the vote - expected to fall on 5 May - will give a \"clear and fundamental\" choice between Labour investment and Conservative cuts. Speaking at Labour's spring conference in Gateshead, Mr Brown claimed the NHS was not safe in Conservative hands. He said Tory plans to cut £35bn tax would \"cut deep into public service\".\n",
      "\n",
      "To a packed audience at Gateshead's Sage Centre, the chancellor said the cuts proposed by shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin were the equivalent of sacking every teacher, GP and nurse in the country, he told activists. Laying into the Conservative's record in government he said: \"I give you this promise - with Labour, Britain will never return to the mistakes of ERM and 10% inflation, 15% interest rates, £3bn in lost reserves, 250,000 repossessed, one million in negative equity and three million unemployed. \"Never again Tory boom and bust.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This will be the central dividing line at the election, between a Conservative Party taking Britain back and planning deep cuts of £35bn in our services, and a Labour government taking Britain forward, which on a platform of stability will reform and renew our hospitals, schools and public services and, I am proud to say, spend by 2008 £60bn more.\" Turning to the economy, the chancellor pledged to continue economic stability and growth in a third term in power.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said after seven years Labour had transformed from a party not trusted with the economy to \"the only party trusted with the economy\". It was now a \"party not just of employees, but of employers and managers\", he said. In the speech - which prompted a standing ovation from an audience clearly \"warm\" to Mr Brown - he also promised to end teenage unemployment within the next five years. He also highlighted plans for 100% debt relief for the world's poorest countries, a national minimum wage for 16 and 17-year-olds and the creation of a network of children's centres and flexibility in maternity leave.

      "The prime minister is trying to draw a line under speculation over the state of his relationship with Gordon Brown with the speech in Chatham, Kent. He is saying that prosperity means both individual wealth and ensuring \"radically improved\" public services. He is also claiming Labour is more ideologically united than ever. Mr Brown is currently touring Africa after a week of facing questions about reports of his splits with Downing Street.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the election widely predicted for May, angry Labour MPs this week warned Mr Blair and Mr Brown about the dangers of disunity.

Labour made low inflation, unemployment and mortgage rates the centrepiece of a new poster campaign this week.\n",

The book claims the premier went back on his pledge after support from Cabinet allies and suspicion that Mr Brown was manoeuvring against him. Mr Peston's book claimed that Mr Brown told Mr Blair: \"There is nothing you could ever say to me now that I could ever believe.\" On Wednesday Mr Blair directly denied Mr Brown made that quote, and before he left for Africa on Tuesday the chancellor told reporters: \"Of course I trust the prime minister.\"\n",

      "Tory leader Michael Howard says his party can save £35bn in government spending by tackling waste.\n",
      "\n",
      "The money would be ploughed back into frontline services like the NHS and schools with the rest used to cut government borrowing and reduce taxes. The Tory leader has also shrugged off the defection of one of his MPs, Robert Jackson, a former minister, to Labour. Mr Howard said that these things happened in politics and it would not affect the outcome of the election. \"Let's be realistic - the election is not going to be decided on the basis of what Mr Jackson did\", he told BBC 1's Breakfast with Frost programme. However the defection on Saturday has cast a shadow over the launch of the Conservatives' spending plans. Fuller details are due to be unveiled on Monday.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bulk of the £35bn saved by tackling bureaucracy and inefficient systems will go back into frontline services, Mr Howard said. The £12bn left over would then be spent on reducing government borrowing, he added. However, the remainder would deal with some of the \"unfair taxes\". \"Almost every independent expert says if you get another Labour government you are going to have to pay higher taxes,\" Mr Howard insisted. \"Because borrowing is going up, it is out of control, that is bound to lead to higher taxes or higher interest rates or both. \"So part of the £12bn we are going to apply to filling the government's black hole, reducing the borrowing. \"The rest will be used to reduce these unfair taxes which are bearing so heavily on the people of our country today.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Howard is expected to say that around £6bn will be available for tax cuts when he makes his announcement on Monday. The cuts will be paid for out of the savings identified by business trouble-shooter David James. Home Office spending could be cut by £1.6bn, according to the final instalment of his year-long review. Savings of £153m at the Foreign Office and £336m at the Department for Culture Media and Sport, have also been identified. In all, almost a quarter of a million jobs and 168 public bodies would go under Mr James' proposals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Howard said: \"All this adds up to a bottom line and the bottom line is at this election people will have a clear choice between Mr Blair, who will waste more and tax more, and a Conservative government that will give them value for money and tax less.\" However, Chief Treasury Secretary Paul Boateng said: \"None of the Tories' figures add up so they can't make these savings and can't pay for any tax cuts, which means the only guaranteed cut from the Tories is £35bn of cuts, hitting frontline public services hard.\" Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy added: \"People will not be taken in by Michael Howard's claims of £35bn worth of savings. \"This can't be achieved without drastic cuts in local services in their own communities.\" A poll for the News of the World newspaper suggests the Conservatives are on course for their worst election defeat in a century. Labour will hold key marginal constituencies, winning a majority of 160, the Populus survey suggests. And the Liberal Democrats will take three key seats from the Conservatives, leaving the Tories with just 163 MPs, two less than they returned atLabour's 1997 landslide and their worst showing since 1906.\n",

      "Chancellor rallies Labour voters\n",
      "\n",
      "Gordon Brown has issued a rallying cry to supporters, warning the \"stakes are too high\" to stay at home or protest vote in the next general election.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chancellor said the poll - expected to fall on 5 May - would give a \"clear and fundamental\" choice between Labour investment and Tory cuts. He told his party's spring conference the Tories must not be allowed to win. The Conservatives and Lib Dems insisted that voters faced higher taxes and means-testing under Labour.\n",
      "\n",
      "To a packed audience at Gateshead's Sage Centre, Mr Brown accused shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin of plotting cuts that were the equivalent of sacking every teacher, GP and nurse in the country. Laying into the Conservative's record in government he said: \"I give you this promise - with Labour, Britain will never return to the mistakes of ERM and 10% inflation, 15% interest rates, £3bn in lost reserves, 250,000 repossessed, one million in negative equity and three million unemployed. \"Never again Tory boom and bust.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This will be the central dividing line at the election, between a Conservative Party taking Britain back and planning deep cuts of £35bn in our services, and a Labour government taking Britain forward, which on a platform of stability will reform and renew our hospitals, schools and public services and, I am proud to say, spend by 2008 £60bn more.\" Turning to the economy, the chancellor promised to continue economic stability and growth in a third term in power.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also pledged to continue the fight against child and pensioner poverty. And he promised help to get young people on the property ladder. \"My message to the thousands of young couples waiting to obtain their first home is that housing is rightly now at the centre of our coming manifesto,\" he said. \"And the next Labour government will match our low mortgage rates with a new first-time buyers' initiative.\" In the speech, which prompted a standing ovation, he also promised to end teenage unemployment within the next five years.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also highlighted plans for 100% debt relief for the world's poorest countries, a national minimum wage for 16 and 17-year-olds, the creation of a network of children's centres and flexibility in maternity leave. Responding to the speech, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, George Osborne, said: \"This was more talk from Gordon Brown. \"We've heard it all before. Instead of talking about the future he kept on talking about the past. \"He completely failed to say which taxes he would put up to fill the black hole in his spending plans. \"There will be a simple choice at the election - value for money and lower taxes with the Conservatives, or more waste and higher taxes under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Liberal Democrat shadow chancellor Vince Cable warned the picture was not as rosy as Mr Brown would like to portray it. \"For all his trumpeting of Labour's management of the economy, Gordon Brown's record is very mixed,\" he said. \"Gordon Brown has created a system of massive centralisation and bureaucracy, a system which subjects millions of people to means testing, and a system of taxation which is extremely complex. \"For all his positive words, Gordon Brown is faced with economic problems looming on the horizon, not least the unprecedented levels of personal debt facing the nation.\" Also in Gateshead, the prime minister took questions sent in by e-mail, text message and telephone as part of Labour's attempt to engage the public in their campaign. Mr Blair told the audience he believed the Iraq war would have made Britain a safer place if its emerging democracy succeeded and that he wanted to bring troops home as soon as possible, but not before the job was done. He also said he wanted to carry on as PM \"because I still think that there are big changes our country needs\".\n",

      "\n",
      "Wales record cap holder Gareth Llewellyn will retire from Test rugby at the end of the Six Nations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The veteran lock, who is 36 at the end of February, told BBC Wales Scrum V that it is time for him to bring down the curtain on his 92-cap Wales career. Llewellyn is on a one-season deal with French club side Narbonne, but said he may consider retiring from all rugby. \"I don't know what I'll do next year, whether to carry on playing or make a change in my career,\" Llewellyn said. \"Narbonne are really keen for me to stay on for next year, so I've got to decide whether to stay on there or maybe go somewhere else, but ultimitely coaching is where I'd like to end up. \"I've done all the coaching awards and everything you can do in that respect, so it's just hopefully getting a chance somewhere.\" Fellow locks Robert Sidoli and Brent Cockbain, who both scored tries in Saturday's Six Nations win in Italy, are Wales coach Mike Ruddock's preferred starters in the second row.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the resurgence of the Dragons' Ian Gough and the adaptibility of lock-cum-flanker Jon Thomas on the bench, Llewellyn has not yet made a match-day squad this Six Nations campaign. But the former Neath and Ospreys player is still targetting one last outing in the red shirt. \"If I do get on the field then brilliant, although the boys are doing really well and I'm very pleased for them,\" Llewellyn added. \"We've had some really tough years in Wales and the players have been through a hell of a lot. \"Sometimes the easiest thing would have been to throw the towel in and walk away, but a few of us dug in there and it's really nice to see some of the boys getting the rewards now. \"I was going to retire at the end of the last Six Nations, I'd even told some of the boys in the squad about it. \"But Mike (Ruddock) asked me to carry on for another season, which I've done, still part of the squad, still trying to help them out as much as I can.\" Llewellyn made his Wales debut in 1989 against New Zealand as a 20-year-old, having caught the selectors' eyes in the All Blacks' tour match against Neath. The 6ft 6in player has not looked back since, going on to break Neil Jenkins' Wales cap record on 12 June 2004 in the 50-44 loss in Argentina.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's been lots of highs - winning the Six Nations in '94, beating England in '93, I've been on some great tours and seen some fantastic countries,\" Llewellyn said. \"But I think the best thing of all for me was the time I spent with the players, I've met some great guys in rugby and made some great friends. \"It'll be a bit strange on international days having to find somewhere to watch Wales play, but at least I might have time to get my golf handicap down!\" Llewellyn captained Neath for seven seasons, while being an integral part of the Neath-Swansea Ospreys regional side's first season. But with the Ospreys building for the future, Llewellyn was eventually forced to look to France for employment - digging in his heels during contract negotiations to insist he must be allowed to play for Wales.\n",

      "Lewis Moody has flown to Dublin to join England's camp ahead of their RBS Six Nations game against Ireland on Sunday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite joining the squad, the Leicester flanker only has a \"slim\" chance of playing because of an infection in his finger. A decision will be taken on Saturday as to whether the 26-year-old will be declared fit. If he fails to recover in time for the game, his place at the back of the pack will be taken by Andy Hazell. Chris Jones will then start the game on the bench. \"The chances of him playing are very slim,\" said coach Andy Robinson. \"The infection is deeper than was thought.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Moody had to be put on a drip in an attempt to force antibiotics through his infected finger. He suffered the cut playing against France at Twickenham and it became infected during a 10-minute outing as a replacement for Leicester against Newcastle last Saturday. \"The mud got into it,\" Robinson added. \"He has had a big course of antibiotics but they haven't done the job we hoped they would.\" Robinson has already been forced to make one change to the starting line-up with Bath prop Matt Stevens coming in for the injured Phil Vickery.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 22-year-old has only made 10 starts for his club but has made 49 appearances from the bench. \"It can be frustrating but I've had a lot more game time this season and I'm ready for it,\" Stevens said. \"I've been on tour with these boys and I've been in the England set-up for two years so I know the calls and the way they play.\" Stevens will be winning his third cap on Sunday after coming on twice as a replacement on the tour to New Zealand last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Robinson has confirmed that fly-half Charlie Hodgson will be the first-choice kicker despite his three missed penalties and a drop goal against France. \"Charlie's state of mind is very good,\" said Robinson. \"Obviously, we are all disappointed we lost the French game and the circumstances in which we did. \"But he responded well last week in his goalkicking for Sale and he will be our first-choice kicker this week.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Robinson also admits his side must improve their line-out work against Irish duo Malcolm O'Kelly and Paul O'Connell, one of the most effective partnerships in the game. \"In each game we've missed a number of line-outs,\" he added. \"It cost us the game against Wales but it has improved. \"It was better against France and will have to go up another notch against Ireland. It will be a huge battle. \"Look at the way they tore us apart last year. If it doesn't function, we will be in for a torrid time.\"\n",

      "Duff sustained a knee injury in the FA Cup defeat at Newcastle and manager Jose Mourinho said: \"He cannot run. His injury is very painful, so he is out.\" But Mourinho has revealed defender Willian Gallas and striker Didier Drogba will be in the starting line-up. The Blues boss took the unusual step of naming his side a day before the match, with Jole Cole named in midfield. Mourinho said: \"We have one more session but I think Drogba will play, and Gallas will play. \"Drogba trained on Monday with no problems and will do the same on Tuesday. Gallas feels he can play and wants to play. We are protecting him still but he will be okay to play.\" Drogba, Chelsea's £24m striker, has missed the last three weeks through injury.\n",

      "\n",
      "Chelsea left-back Wayne Bridge could miss the rest of the season with a suspected broken ankle.\n",
      "\n",
      "The England international, 24, was hurt in an innocuous challenge with Alan Shearer during the Londoners' FA Cup defeat at Newcastle on Sunday. \"We think it's a big injury,\" said Jose Mourinho, whose Chelsea team this week meet Barcelona in the Champions League and Liverpool in the Carling Cup final. William Gallas and Damien Duff could also miss the Barcelona game. France defender Gallas and Ireland winger Duff both picked up their injuries in the closing stages of Chelsea's 1-0 defeat at St James' Park.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Bridge having gone off after Mourinho used all three substitutes, those knocks plus Carlo Cudicini's red card meant Chelsea finished the game with seven able-bodied players. Cudicini would not have played against Barcelona, but had been promised a game in the Carling Cup final, although he will now miss the Cardiff showpiece through suspension. The manager is not planning to add any new names to his squad ahead of the trip to Barcelona, even though he has few options to replace Bridge at left-back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Celestine Babayaro left the club in January, ironically to join Newcastle, and although Gallas has deputised at left-back before, he is struggling to be fit himself. It could be that Paulo Ferreira, usually a right-back, is switched to left-back with Glen Johnson, who ended the Newcastle game in goal, playing on the right. Youngsters Ben Hudell, Joe Keenan and Sam Tillen would be options should Mourinho decide to call up a replacement, but it is unlikely he would risk an untried prospect in a Champions League tie. Bridge's injury also means Mourinho, who reportedly wants to sign Ashley Cole from Arsenal, will not have a specialist, senior left-back for the run-in to the season.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He (Bridge) has no chance of playing against Barcelona, probably will not play against Liverpool (in the Carling Cup final) and maybe not for the rest of the season,\" he said. \"The medical department will try to do everything to recover Gallas and Duff. We will have to wait and see, but I won't cry about injuries because we will have 11 players to play on Tuesday.\" Shearer said he was unsure what caused Bridge's injury. \"I don't know what happened.\" he said. \"It was just a shame. I don't think we even touched each other. \"By all accounts it's pretty serious. I went into the dressing-room after the game and wished him all the best.\" Mourinho, whose team are chasing three trophies, has already lost winger Arjen Robben to a serious injury.\n",

      "\n",
      "Wales number eight Michael Owen says replacing Gareth Thomas as Wales' captain will be straightforward because of the leadership quality in the squad.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You dream about playing for Wales, but it never enters your head that you will one day captain your country,\" he said. \"It's an easy job really because there are so many experienced players in the side, but it will be a massive honour.\" Coach Mike Ruddock says the 24-year-old should take the armband from broken thumb victim Thomas against Scotland. Ruddock praised Owen's contribution as vice-captain and pack leader in this year's wins over England, Italy and France, notably his role in the second-half in Paris following Thomas' injury. The 22-cap Dragons man says that Thomas will be badly missed, though. \"Gareth is going to be a massive loss because he is a brilliant player and he has done a fantastic job since he has been captain,\" said Owen. \"He has put his own unique stamp on things. We are going to miss him but the strength of the squad is shown when you have someone like Kevin Morgan to step in.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Owen admitted the Grand Slam had been mentioned within the squad but that no-one was getting carried away with the three victories over England, Italy and France. \"We can't get ahead of ourselves,\" he said. \"We have a massive game next up and we are just looking forward to preparing for that. \"Scotland are improving all the time. Like us they did well in France and were unlucky not to get a win. \"Against Ireland they played fantastically well in the first 15 minutes before falling away. \"They are probably going on a similar journey to the one we have been on in the last couple of years.\"\n",

The event is split into two groups of four with the top two from each advancing to the semi-finals.\n",

      "Mauresmo's win was her ninth in a row as she tries to overtake Lindsay Davenport for the number one spot. Mauresmo spent five weeks at number one after the US Open before injury ushered Davenport back in front. \"Since then, I feel very confident on court and my game is there. I want to get the ranking back, but it's very different than before I was number one. \"It was an obsession, but now I take it in a relaxed way.\" Mauresmo completed her first match in the season-ending championship in 54 minutes as Russia's Zvonareva struggled to return her serve and failed to achieve a single break point.\n",

Maybe that is why I couldn't do 100%. But I was fighting.\" Sharapova, who lost 6-2 6-2 to Kuznetsova in Beijing in September, said: \"In Beijing, she was coming off such a big winning streak [14 matches] and she was unstoppable. \"This time, it was important to start off well and put some pressure on her.\" The tournament debutant added: \"I love it here. The atmosphere is great. \"To be here where the Lakers play, you just feel that excitement. I love basketball.\" Williams admitted she is still some way off her best form but remained positive after two wins in two days. \"It's hard to go out there and get it right but I'm fighting and I'm hoping,\" said Williams. \"What makes me happy is the effort.

      "\"I have to be positive, I still have a few weeks,\" she said. \"My body has to get accustomed again to the stress, the rhythm.\" Henin-Hardenne slid down the world rankings in the second half of 2004 after contracting the illness in April. After an initial lay-off, she was forced off the circuit for a second time after being knocked out of the French Open in the second round. A comeback at the US Open after a three-month absence ended when she crashed out at the fourth-round stage. But despite her problems, she still won five of the nine official tournaments she entered in 2004 and won Olympic gold in Athens, an achievement which saw her named Belgian sportswoman of the year on Friday. \"Physically, it's obvious that I hit rock bottom,\" said the 22-year-old, who will make her comeback in the Sydney International from 10-16 January. \"Since April, with the exception of the Olympics, I have not done much. \"All the successes I had prior to that were mainly due to the work I put in on building up my fitness. \"Now it's time to get back to putting in 200% effort and I think I am capable of doing that.\"\n",

In a see-saw second set, Bondarenko raced into a 5-2 lead and though Mirza hauled herself level, the Ukrainian broke again before finally levelling the match. Mirza rediscovered the aggressive strokes that took her to the first set in the decider established a 5-2 lead. At 5-3, the stadium erupted in celebration when Mirza thought she had delivered an ace to secure victory but the serve was ruled to have clipped the net.

Eton Corporation's Porsche designed P7131 digital radio set will be launched both as a DAB radio in the UK as well as a satellite radio set in the US. DAB sets have been slow to take-off in the UK, but this one concentrates on sleek looks as much as technology. \"It is for the risqu&#233; consumer,\" said an Eton spokesperson. \"We are proud of it because it has the sound quality for the audiophile and the looks for the design-conscious consumer.\" The Porsche radio is set to go on sale at the end of January in the US and in the first quarter of 2005 in the UK. In the US is it expected to cost $250 (£133). \n",

      "The average person has a library of 600 digital images estimates the Consumer Electronics Association, the organisation behind CES. This is expected to grow to a massive 3,420 images - or 7.2GB - in five years' time. One gadget that might help swell that collection is Sanyo's tiny handheld VPC-C4 camcorder which is another innovation in design and engineering award winner. It combines high quality video and stills in a very small device. It takes MPEG4 video quality at 30 frames a second and has a four megapixel still camera. Images and video are stored on SD cards, which have come down in price in recent months. A 512MB card will store about 30 minutes of video and 420 stills. The device is so tiny it can be controlled with one thumb. Because images and video are stored on SD memory, it is portable to other devices and means other data like audio can be stored on the card too. \n",

      "\n",
      "\"Welcome to CeBit 2005\" was the message from the pilot as we landed, the message on flyers at the airport, and the message on just about every billboard in town. CeBit fever has taken over Hanover. Hotels have been booked out for months; local people are letting out rooms in their homes to the hoards of exhibitors, visitors, and journalists. CeBit itself is huge, the exhibition site could almost be classified as a town in its own right.\n",

      "There are restaurants, shops, and a bus service between the halls - of which there are 27. There are more than 6,000 companies here, showing their latest products. The list of them that I was given when I came in is the size and weight of a phone book. One of the mains themes this year is the digital home, and one of the key buzzwords is convergence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"entertainment PC\" is being billed as the replacement for DVD players, stereos, telephones and computers - offering a one-box solution, wirelessly connected throughout a house. To show them off, one display has been modelled as a prototype \"digital lifestyle home\" by German magazine Computer Reseller News. \"We wanted to show how this fits into a living room or workplace, to give people a feeling how it would work in their homes,\" said Claudia Neulling from the magazine. The house has webcams for security in each room, which can be called up on the high definition TV, connected to the PC in the living room.\n",
      "\n",
      "That PC provides home entertainment, movies or music. It can also be linked to the car parked outside, which is kitted out with a processor of its own, along with a DVD player and cordless headphones for the kids in the back. \"Convergence for me is about how technology, the transfer of data, can do things that make it easier and more convenient for me as a consumer,\" said Mark Brailey, director of corporate marketing for Intel. \"The real challenge is to show people it's easier than they think, and fun.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He firmly believes that entertainment PCs are the future, but says they have to get past people's fears of frequent crashes and incompatibilities. That is something Microsoft is trying to do too - its stand has computers running Windows XP Media Centre edition 2005 for people to try out. Mobile phones do not escape the convergence theme. Samsung is showing off its SGH-i300, a handset with a three gigabyte hard drive, that can be used to watch compressed video or as an MP3 player. And if you would rather watch live TV than a downloaded movie NEC is showing a phone, on sale in China, which can show analogue TV on its colour screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think the most probable application is at somewhere like the train station - if you want to check the status of the soccer game for example\" said Koji Umemoto, manager of mobile terminals marketing for NEC. He admitted that the signal quality is not very good if you are on the move, and they do not have plans to launch it in Europe at the moment. Nokia was happy to demonstrate its 6230i, an upgrade to the very popular 6230.\n",
      "\n",
      "It now has a 1.3 megapixel camera, and a music player that can handle multiple formats, rather than just MP3s. It is also compatible with Nokia's new Visual Radio technology. The handset can receive FM broadcasts, and the user can interact with compatible broadcasts using a GPRS connection, to take part in competitions or get extra information such as the name of the song playing. Most companies are reluctant to show prototypes, preferring to display products that are already on sale, or just about to hit the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Portable media player firm Creative showed off a new wireless technology, based on magnetic inductance rather than radio - a system some hearing aids use. \"The benefits over conventional Bluetooth are the lack of interference, and longer battery life,\" said Riccardo de Rinaldini, Creative's European marketing manager. The firm has a prototype headset linked up to a Zen Micro player. The transmitter on the player creates a private, magnetic \"bubble\" around the user, which is picked up by the headset. The range is only about one metre so it is only suitable for personal use. A single AAA battery is said to last up to 30 hours. Creative expects it to hit the market in its final form later this year. Even clothing is likely to be part of the convergence trend. Adidas has a trainer which, according to Susanne Risse from the company, can \"sense, understand, and adapt to your running style\". It has a battery, processor, and motor embedded in the sole. Buttons on the side allow you to set the amount of cushioning you would like by adjusting the tension on a cable running through the heel. The processor then monitors the surface you are running on, and adjusts the tension accordingly. It is being billed as \"the world's first intelligent shoe\".\n",

      "Gamers could drive high-definition\n",
      "\n",
      "TV, films, and games have been gearing up for some time now for the next revolution to transform the quality of what is on our screens.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is called high-definition - HD for short - and it is already hugely popular in Japan and the US. It is set, according to analysts, to do for images what CDs did for sound. Different equipment able to receive HD signals is needed though and is expensive. But Europe's gamers may be the early adopters to drive demand. Europeans will have to wait until at least 2006 until they see mainstream HDTV.\n",
      "\n",
      "To view it, it needs to be transmitted in HD format, and people need special receivers and displays that can handle the high-quality resolution. The next generation of consoles, however, are expected to start appearing at the end of 2005, start of 2006. And most new computer displays and plasma sets are already capable of handling such high-resolution pictures. \"In the next generation [of consoles] HD support is mandatory,\" Dr Mark Tuffy games systems director at digital content firm THX told the BBC News website. \"Every game is going to be playable in HD. \"So consumers who have gone out and spent all this money on HDTVs, and who have no content to watch, are going to be blown away by these really high-detail pictures. \"It's going to change really the way they look at gaming.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of last year, Chris Deering, Sony's European president, made a prediction that 20 million European households would have HDTV sets by 2008. A previous prediction from analysts Datamonitor put the figure at 4.6 million by 2008, an increase from an estimated 50,000 sets at the end of 2003. But those in Europe may see little point in buying what is quite an expensive bit of technology - about £2,000 - if there are few programmes or films to watch on them. Satellite broadcaster BSkyB is planning HDTV services in 2006 and the BBC intends to produce all of its content in HD by 2010.\n",
      "\n",
      "Until broadcast rights, format standards - and the practicalities of updating equipment - are agreed, TV content will be limited. All TV images are made up of pixels which go across the screen, and scan lines which go down the screen. Most standard UK TV pictures are made up of 625 lines and about 700 pixels. HD offers up to 1,080 active lines, with each line made up of 1,920 pixels. This means the picture is up to six times as sharp as standard TV. \"Probably, in the UK [gaming] is going to be the only thing you are going to really be able to show off, as in 'look what this TV can do', until HD is really adopted by broadcasters,\" explains Dr Tuffy. But gamers are also the ideal target audience for HD because they always crave better quality graphics, and more immersive gaming experiences. They are used to spending money on hardware to match a game's requirements. Demographics have changed too and the \"sweet spot\" for the games industry is the gamer in his or her late 20s. This means they are likely to have higher disposable incomes and can afford the price of big-screen, high-definition display technologies and HD projectors, earlier than others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Higher capacity storage discs, such as HD-DVD and blue-ray , are set to be standard in the next round of games consoles - allowing developers more room for detailed graphics.\n",
      "\n",
      "For console developers though, HD offers some production changes. It could make games production slightly more expensive, thinks Dr Tuffy. \"But we may see the cross-platform development of games becoming more common because they will more easily be able to take a PC game and apply it to a console,\" he says. \"You are literally going to get to the point, with a Lord of the Rings game for example, is going to be closer and closer to the actual film, especially the CGI stuff from the DVD. \"And the transition when they move from a cut scene to the game, just now they have almost got it seamless.\" With HD, he says, the transition will be completely seamless and the same quality as the big-screen cinema release. This could herald an increasing convergence between the film and gaming industry. But it may not be until the generation after the next games consoles where the two industries really collide. At that point, says Dr Tuffy, games could become more or less interactive movies.\n",

      "TV future in the hands of viewers\n",
      "\n",
      "With home theatre systems, plasma high-definition TVs, and digital video recorders moving into the living room, the way people watch TV will be radically different in five years' time.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is according to an expert panel which gathered at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas to discuss how these new technologies will impact one of our favourite pastimes. With the US leading the trend, programmes and other content will be delivered to viewers via home networks, through cable, satellite, telecoms companies, and broadband service providers to front rooms and portable devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most talked-about technologies of CES has been digital and personal video recorders (DVR and PVR). These set-top boxes, like the US's TiVo and the UK's Sky+ system, allow people to record, store, play, pause and forward wind TV programmes when they want.\n",
      "\n",
      "Essentially, the technology allows for much more personalised TV. They are also being built-in to high-definition TV sets, which are big business in Japan and the US, but slower to take off in Europe because of the lack of high-definition programming. Not only can people forward wind through adverts, they can also forget about abiding by network and channel schedules, putting together their own a-la-carte entertainment. But some US networks and cable and satellite companies are worried about what it means for them in terms of advertising revenues as well as \"brand identity\" and viewer loyalty to channels. Although the US leads in this technology at the moment, it is also a concern that is being raised in Europe, particularly with the growing uptake of services like Sky+. \"What happens here today, we will see in nine months to a years' time in the UK,\" Adam Hume, the BBC Broadcast's futurologist told the BBC News website. For the likes of the BBC, there are no issues of lost advertising revenue yet. It is a more pressing issue at the moment for commercial UK broadcasters, but brand loyalty is important for everyone. \"We will be talking more about content brands rather than network brands,\" said Tim Hanlon, from brand communications firm Starcom MediaVest. \"The reality is that with broadband connections, anybody can be the producer of content.\" He added: \"The challenge now is that it is hard to promote a programme with so much choice.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "What this means, said Stacey Jolna, senior vice president of TV Guide TV group, is that the way people find the content they want to watch has to be simplified for TV viewers. It means that networks, in US terms, or channels could take a leaf out of Google's book and be the search engine of the future, instead of the scheduler to help people find what they want to watch. This kind of channel model might work for the younger iPod generation which is used to taking control of their gadgets and what they play on them. But it might not suit everyone, the panel recognised. Older generations are more comfortable with familiar schedules and channel brands because they know what they are getting. They perhaps do not want so much of the choice put into their hands, Mr Hanlon suggested. \"On the other end, you have the kids just out of diapers who are pushing buttons already - everything is possible and available to them,\" said Mr Hanlon. \"Ultimately, the consumer will tell the market they want.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the 50,000 new gadgets and technologies being showcased at CES, many of them are about enhancing the TV-watching experience. High-definition TV sets are everywhere and many new models of LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) TVs have been launched with DVR capability built into them, instead of being external boxes. One such example launched at the show is Humax's 26-inch LCD TV with an 80-hour TiVo DVR and DVD recorder. One of the US's biggest satellite TV companies, DirectTV, has even launched its own branded DVR at the show with 100-hours of recording capability, instant replay, and a search function. The set can pause and rewind TV for up to 90 hours. And Microsoft chief Bill Gates announced in his pre-show keynote speech a partnership with TiVo, called TiVoToGo, which means people can play recorded programmes on Windows PCs and mobile devices. All these reflect the increasing trend of freeing up multimedia so that people can watch what they want, when they want.\n",

      "\n",
      "Music downloading, for those that have rejected the free peer to peer services, can be a costly business.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cost of paying even as little as 70p per track can add up, particularly for those people who own one of the new generation of players that can store thousands of songs. Paying per track for music is becoming as outmoded as paying per minute for internet access and alternative monthly or yearly subscription models are springing up as a more convenient, and ultimately cheaper way of owning music.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Music fans are moving away from buying the traditional bundled package of a dozen or more songs that we used to call an album to newer ways that fit their lifestyle; either single tracks or subscriptions services,\" said Paul Myers, chief executive of Wippit, a UK-based music download service. While iTunes is doing good business with its sales of individual tracks to iPod owners, others are questioning whether the concept of owning music is even valid in the digital age. Napster is due to launch a new rental subscription service - dubbed Napster to Go in the UK in the next few months. The service can be used on players that support Microsoft Windows latest Digital Rights Management technology known as Janus. This includes players made by Samsung, Rio and Creative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently on offer in beta-version in the US, the service costs $15 per month for unlimited downloads. The technology ensures that music downloaded to the player only remains playable while the user subscribes to the service. Users need to update their license on a monthly basis or the tunes will no longer play.\n",
      "\n",
      "This has outraged some digital music lovers, especially as Napster already offers a cheaper service for downloading music to the PC. Napster claims the higher price is a result of record labels charging more for the to-go service and says it also offers \"greater value\" for customers. Mr Myers is not convinced a rental model will work for consumers. \"We've been offering our unlimited music subscription service for more than three years now and our customers know what they want. Format interoperability, excellent value and the reassurance that music purchased from Wippit is theirs to keep and enjoy on whatever device they choose,\" he said. \"Who wants to download a track that won't play next month if you decide to unsubscribe to the service or change portable player for an iPod or the latest mobile phone?\" Wippit offers a download subscription service for £4.99 per month or £50 per year. It has a catalogue of around 60,000 songs.\n",

      "Arsenal through on penalties\n",
      "\n",
      "Arsenal win 4-2 on penalties\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spanish goalkeeper saved from Alan Quinn and Jon Harley as Arsenal sealed a quarter-final trip to Bolton with a 4-2 victory on penalties. Lauren, Patrick Vieira, Freddie Ljungberg and Ashley Cole scored for Arsenal, while Andy Gray and Phil Jagielka were on target for the Blades. Michael Tonge and Harley wasted chances for the underdogs, but Paddy Kenny was inspired to keep Arsenal at bay. Arsenal, stripped of attacking talent such as Thierry Henry and Dennis Bergkamp, partnered 17-year-old Italian striker Arturo Lupoli with Ljungberg up front. It was a revamped Arsenal line-up, and they were almost a goal behind within seconds as Tonge wasted a glorious chance. Gray ran free down the right flank, and his cross left Tonge with the simplest of chances, but he blazed over the top from six yards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arsenal were barely seen as an attacking force in the opening 45 minutes, although Ljungberg turned a half-chance wide after good work by Cesc Fabregas. Arsene Wenger introduced Quincy Owusu-Abeyie for the ineffective Lupoli at half-time, and the pacy Dutch youngster had an immediate impact. He ran clear after good work by Mathieu Flamini, but his finish was tame and Kenny saved easily. Owusu-Abeyie then fired in a testing cross, which was met by Fabregas, and it needed a desperate clearance by Kenny's legs to save the Blades. Arsenal were now totally dominant, and were desperately unlucky not to take the lead after 62 minutes when Fabregas crashed a rising drive against the bar from 20 yards. It then took a brilliant tackle by Jagielka to deny Ljungberg as he was poised to strike. Arsenal continued to press, and once again Kenny was called into action with eight minutes left, diving low to clutch another close-range effort from Fabregas. Neil Warnock's side almost snatched victory in the dying seconds when Derek Geary's cross found Harley at the far post, but his diving header was brilliantly turned over by Almunia. Owusu-Abeyie's pace was causing all sorts of problems for the Blades, and as extra-time began, another surging run into the penalty area almost set up a chance for Ljungberg. Pascal Cygan missed Arsenal's best chance after 106 minutes, blazing across the face of goal when he was unmarked at the far post. Arsenal sent on Jeremie Aliadiere with seven minutes of extra-time left, and he almost broke the deadlock with his first touch. Kolo Toure's misplaced free-kick landed at his feet, but Kenny once again blocked from a tight angle. Arsenal laid siege to Sheffield United's goal in the dying minutes, but they somehow held on to force penalties. Almunia was then Arsenal's hero as another brave Blades cup campaign came to a losing end.\n",

      "Hugo Southwell's try gave the Scots an early 8-0 lead but scores from locks Malcolm O'Kelly and Paul O'Connell put the visitors in command by half-time. A third try from wing Denis Hickie and third penalty from Ronan O'Gara, who kicked 13 points, extended the lead. Jon Petrie scored a second try for Scotland but late scores from John Hayes and Gavin Duffy sealed victory. After two hard-earned away victories, Eddie O'Sullivan' side can now look forward to welcoming England to Lansdowne Road in a fortnight. Scotland will try to give their coach Matt Williams a first Six Nations victory when Italy come to Edinburgh, but they again struggled to turn pressure into points. The home side started with tremendous intensity and dominated territory and possession in the opening 10 minutes. A powerful charge from flanker Jason White was carried on by Ali Hogg and when Ireland conceded a penalty close to their own line, Scotland kicked it to touch. The Irish defence foiled the home side on that occasion, but a stray hand in a ruck allowed Paterson to stroke over a penalty in the eighth minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "If that was a paltry reward for their early pressure, Scotland got the try they deserved when Paterson's searing break and Andy Craig's pass sent Southwell streaking to the right corner. Paterson was off target with the conversion and fly-half Dan Parks then missed a presentable drop-goal attempt. Ireland got themselves on the scoreboard with an O'Gara penalty and by the 24th minute the visitors were ahead. Stuart Grimes pulled down O'Kelly at a line-out, Ireland kicked the penalty to touch and from the set-piece, the big lock was driven over by the rest of his pack.\n",
      "\n",
      "O'Gara added the conversion and a further penalty, after Shane Horgan almost grabbed a second try from O'Gara's chip to the corner, only for the ball to spill from his hand. But Ireland still delivered a hammer blow to Scotland's hopes just before the interval. O'Connell - skipper in the absence of Brian O'Driscoll - powered through Parks' weak tackle after a free-kick from a scrummage to burrow over.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scotland suffered a further blow on the resumption when Ireland flanker Johnny O'Connor won another vital turnover, and O'Gara's basketball pass sent Hickie over in the left corner. O'Gara converted and then thumped over a 40m penalty to give the visitors a commanding 28-8 advantage. Scotland looked bereft of ideas but a half-break from Paterson sparked them back to life just before the hour. Stuart Grimes won a line-out and a well-worked move saw Petrie scuttle round the side of the ruck to dive over in the left corner. But it proved a false dawn, and Ireland reasserted their authority in the final 10 minutes. Peter Stringer and O'Kelly combined to put giant prop Hayes over in the right corner before replacement Gavin Duffy scorched away on the left, David Humphreys adding the final flourish with a touchline conversion.\n",

      "Coach Matt Williams' side were outmuscled and outplayed in a tense first half but led 6-3 at the break. Paterson slotted four more second-half penalties and Scotland were denied a try when wing Sean Lamont's touchdown was ruled out for a forward pass. A late Andrea Masi try was small consolation for Italy, chasing their first away win in the Six Nations. Scotland came out on top of the early exchanges and took a quick 3-0 lead through the boot of full-back Paterson. But the more powerful Azzurri pack eventually rumbled into life.\n",
      "\n",
      "A series of drives into Scottish territory set up a penalty attempt, missed by full-back Roland De Marigny, and a wayward drop-goal effort from Luciano Orquera. Scotland defended the initial thrusts but on 20 minutes Italy, after coming up yards short of the line, equalised through a De Marigny penalty. Italy were offered another penalty when Scottish flanker Simon Taylor was offside but the left-footed De Marigny pushed his kick wide. Scotland finally made the most of a rare foray into the Italian half and snatched three points from Paterson when an Italian forward handled the ball in a ruck.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the half wore on, both sides squandered promising spells of momentum with sloppy penalties, and the period fizzled out with Scotland numerically, if not psychologically, on top. Italy's De Marigny narrowly missed a chance to level the scores again shortly after the break but his long-range kick shaved the right upright. And Scotland capitalised with a third Paterson penalty on 50 minutes. Williams' side seemed to have found a spark from somewhere and, after a couple of probing attacks, Paterson was able to slot another three points to widen the gap.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the pendulum of possession swinging towards Scotland, Lamont thought he had wriggled over in the left corner after 65 minutes but play was recalled for a marginal forward pass from Paterson. Another Paterson penalty on 70 minutes kept the pressure on the wilting visitors. But John Kirwan's men had the last laugh when Gordon Ross' attempted clearance was charged down and Masi pounced for the try, converted by De Marigny.\n",

      "The firm said it hoped to pay $100m now and another $120m over eight years. With assets of $200m and liabilities totalling $648m, it needs creditors' backing for the offer to avoid going into bankruptcy. The trading scandal is the biggest to hit Singapore since the $1.2bn collapse of Barings Bank in 1995. Chen Jiulin, chief executive of China Aviation Oil (CAO), was arrested by at Changi Airport by Singapore police on 8 December. He was returning from China, where he had headed when CAO announced its trading debacle in late-November. The firm had been betting heavily on a fall in the price of oil during October, but prices rose sharply instead.\n",

      "Among the creditors whose backing CAO needs for its restructuring plan are banking giants such as Barclay's Capital and Sumitomo Mitsui, as well as South Korean firm SK Energy. Of the immediate payment, the firm - China's biggest jet fuel supplier - said it would be paying $30m out of its own resources. The rest would come from its parent company, China Aviation Oil Holding Company in Beijing. The holding company, owned by the Chinese government, holds most of CAO's Singapore-listed shares.

Under the agreement, Metlife will be able to sell its products through Citigroup over the next 10 years. The deal includes Smith Barney retail brokerages and Citibank branches. The company will pay between $1bn and $3bn in Metlife stock with the rest being made up of cash. Travelers had sales of $5.2bn in 2004 and made a profit of $901m. It has total net assets of $96bn. \"This deal employs some of Metlife's excess capital in a potentially higher-return business and gives it more distribution,\" said Stuart Quint, an analyst at Gartmore.\n",

      "Pan-European group Euronext is poised to launch a bid for the London Stock Exchange, UK media reports say.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last week, the LSE rejected a takeover proposal from German rival Deutsche Boerse - the 530 pence-a-share offer valued the exchange at about £1.35bn. The LSE, which saw its shares rise 25%, said the bid undervalued the business. Euronext - formed after the Brussels, Paris and Amsterdam exchanges merged - is reportedly working with three investment banks on a possible offer. The LSE, Europe's biggest stock market, is a key prize, listing stocks with a total capitalisation of £1.4 trillion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Euronext already has a presence in London due to its 2001 acquisition of London-based options and futures exchange Liffe. Trades on the LSE are cleared via Clearnet, in which Euronext has a quarter stake.\n",
      "\n",
      "Euronext, which also operates an exchange in Lisbon, last week appointed UBS and ABN Amro as additional advisors. It is also working with Morgan Stanley. Despite the rejection of the Deutsche Boerse bid last week, Werner Seifert, chief executive of the Frankfurt-based exchange, may well come back with an improved offer. It has long wanted to link up with London, and the two tried and failed to seal a merger in 2000. Responding to the LSE's rebuff, Deutsche Boerse - whose market capitalisation is more than £3bn - said it believed it could show its proposal offered benefits, and that it still hoped to make a cash bid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last week the LSE said not only was the bid undervalued, but that it had \"been advised that there can be no assurance that any transaction could be successfully implemented\". However, it has indicated it is open for further talks. Meanwhile, German magazine Der Spiegel said part of Mr Seifert's negotiations with the LSE were about where to base the future board of any merged exchange. While Mr Seifert has suggested a merged company would be run out of London, the mayor of Frankfurt has raised concerns that such a move could cost German jobs. Many analysts believe German Boerse has more financial firepower than Euronext if it came to a bidding war.\n",

      "\n",
      "A shareholder in US phone firm MCI has taken legal action to halt a $6.75bn (£3.6bn) buyout by telecoms giant Verizon, hoping to get a better deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lawsuit was filed on Friday after Qwest Communications, which had an earlier offer for MCI rejected, said it would submit an improved bid. MCI's directors have backed Verizon, despite it tabling less money. They are accused of breaching their fiduciary duties by depriving MCI shareholders \"of maximum value\".\n",
      "\n",
      "According the legal papers filed in a Delaware court, Verizon is set to pay an \"\"unconscionable, unfair and grossly inadequate\" sum for MCI, which was formerly known as Worldcom. Qwest said on Wednesday that MCI had rejected a deal worth $8bn. A number of large MCI shareholders expressed unhappiness at the decision, saying that Verizon's offer, made up of cash, shares and dividends, undervalued the company. Friday's lawsuit argues that the Verizon offer makes no provision for future growth prospects and that consolidation in the US phone industry will put a premium on MCI's network, assets and clients. MCI's directors have argued that Verizon is bigger than Qwest, has fewer debts and has built a successful mobile division. Chief executive Michael Capellas spent last week meeting with shareholders in an effort to win their backing.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2002, investors in the then-named Worldcom lost millions when the company filed for bankruptcy following an accounting scandal. However, the firm - now renamed MCI - has put its operations in order and emerged from bankruptcy protection last April. It is a long-distance and corporate phone firm, and would provide the buyer with access to a global telecommunications network and a large number of business-based subscribers. MCI shares jumped on Friday, hitting their highest level since April 2004 amid speculation that it would be the focus of a bidding war. A takeover of MCI would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since October as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. Earlier this month, SBC Communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone pioneer AT&T for about $16bn.\n",

      "US phone company Qwest has said it will table a new offer for MCI after losing out to larger rival Verizon, setting the scene for a possible bidding war.\n",
      "\n",
      "MCI accepted a $6.75bn (£3.6bn) buyout from telecoms giant Verizon on Monday, rejecting a higher offer from Qwest. Qwest chairman Richard Notebaert sent a letter to MCI's board on Thursday saying that it plans to submit a new offer after examining Verizon's bid. Formerly known as Worldcom, MCI is a long-distance and corporate phone firm. Snapping up MCI would give the buyer access to a global telecommunications network and a large number of business-based subscribers. Shares of MCI were up more than 4% in electronic trading after the close of New York markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Qwest said on Wednesday that MCI had rejected a deal worth $8bn. \"We would like to advise you that once we have completed our review of the Verizon merger agreement, we do intend to submit a modified offer to acquire MCI,\" the letter from Qwest said. Verizon's offer is made up of cash, shares and dividends, and a number of investors have said that it undervalues MCI. Verizon plans to swap 0.41 of its shares and $1.50 in cash for each MCI share, as well as offering special dividends of $4.50 a share. Both company boards have backed the deal, but regulators will still need to give their approval. As well as trying to lure investors with the promise of better returns, Qwest also reckons that its offer will face less regulatory scrutiny than Verizon's.\n",

      "The takeover would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since October as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. Earlier this month, SBC Communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone trailblazer AT&T for about $16bn. There may be concerns other than cash, however, especially as MCI only emerged from bankruptcy protection last April. Verizon is far bigger than Qwest, has fewer debts and has built a successful mobile division. Also, MCI, while trading under the name Worldcom, became the biggest corporate bankruptcy in US history after admitting that it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits. Former Worldcom boss Bernie Ebbers is currently standing trial, accused of overseeing an $11bn fraud. Qwest, meanwhile, had to pay the Securities and Exchange Commission $250m in October to settle charges that it massaged earnings to keep Wall Street happy.\n",

      "Germany's economy shrank 0.2% in the last three months of 2004, upsetting hopes of a sustained recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "The figures confounded hopes of a 0.2% expansion in the fourth quarter in Europe's biggest economy. The Federal Statistics Office said growth for the whole of 2004 was 1.6%, after a year of contraction in 2003, down from an earlier estimate of 1.7%. It said growth in the third quarter had been zero, putting the economy at a standstill from July onward. Germany has been reliant on exports to get its economy back on track, as unemployment of more than five million and impending cuts to welfare mean German consumers have kept their money to themselves. Major companies including Volkswagen, DaimlerChrysler and Siemens have spent much of 2004 in tough talks with unions about trimming jobs and costs. According to the statistics office, Destatis, rising exports were outweighed in the fourth quarter by the continuing weakness of domestic demand.\n",

      "Oil prices have fallen heavily for a second day, closing at three-month lows after news that US crude stocks have improved ahead of winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "London Brent crude closed at $40.15 on Thursday - a drop of 5.1% - having dived below $40 a barrel for the first time since mid-September. US light crude traded in New York lost more than $2 to $43.25, its lowest close since 10 September. The price of both benchmark crudes has dropped 12% in two days. The falls were triggered when the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday that US crude stocks were 3.5% higher than a year ago. The news calmed worries about winter shortages. Weak US fuel and heating oil stocks have been a persistent factor in pushing up oil prices. \"It's amazing how quickly sentiment changed,\" said Rick Mueller, an analyst at Energy Security Analysis. Analysts also attributed the fall to mild early-winter weather, which has tempered demand for heating oil.\n",

      "\n",
      "In London, the FTSE 100 index closed 15 points higher at 4,751. The long-awaited drop in oil prices helped to ease persistent investor jitters over the impact of energy costs on company profits and economic growth. However, traders warned that the fall could be short-lived if there is a cold snap in North America this winter or any major supply problems in other parts of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "The price of crude is still up about 30% on the start of 2004, but has fallen from the record of $55.67 set in late October. Opec nations have increased production to 25-year highs to meet global demand and this has helped rebuild US stocks hit by supply disruptions after Hurricane Ivan in September. Traders were also encouraged by comments on Wednesday from the energy minister of Opec member Algeria. Chakib Khelil said the cartel was likely to keep output unchanged when it meets next week. However, some analysts believe the sharp fall in crude prices may harden Opec's attitude to over-production, leading to a scaling back of oil output.\n",

      "The Reserve Bank of Australia lifted interest rates 0.25% to 5.5%, their first upwards move in more than a year. However, shortly after the Bank made its decision, new figures showed a fall in economic growth in the last quarter. The Bank said it had acted to curb inflation but the move was criticised by some analysts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rate hike was the first since December 2003 and had been well-flagged in advance. However, opposition parties and some analysts said the move was ill-timed given data showing the Australian economy grew just 0.1% between October and December and 1.5% on an annual basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The figures, representing a decline from the 0.2% growth in GDP seen between July and September, were below market expectations. Consumer spending remains strong, however, and the Bank is concerned about growing inflationary pressures. \"Over recent months it has become increasingly clear that remaining spare capacity in the labour and goods markets is becoming rather limited,\" said Ian Macfarlane, Governor of the Reserve Bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "At 2.6%, inflation remains within the Bank's 2-3% target range. However, exports declined in the second half of 2004, fuelling a rise in the country's current account deficit - the difference in the value of imports compared to exports - to a record Australian dollar 29.4bn. The Australian government said the economy remained strong with unemployment at a near 30 year low. \"The economy has been strong and it is properly moderating but it doesn't look to me like it's slowing in any unreasonable way,\" said Treasurer Peter Costello. Stock markets had factored in the likelihood of a rate rise but analysts still expressed concern about the strength of the economy. \"That 1.5% annual growth rate is the lowest we have seen since the post-election slump we saw back in 2000-1,\" said Michael Blythe, chief economist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. \"This suggests the economy really did slow very sharply in the second half of 2004.\"\n",

      "Munich-based research institute Ifo said that its confidence index fell to 95.5 in February from 97.5 in January, its first decline in three months. The study found that the outlook in both the manufacturing and retail sectors had worsened. Observers had been hoping that a more confident business sector would signal that economic activity was picking up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're surprised that the Ifo index has taken such a knock,\" said DZ bank economist Bernd Weidensteiner. \"The main reason is probably that the domestic economy is still weak, particularly in the retail trade.\" Economy and Labour Minister Wolfgang Clement called the dip in February's Ifo confidence figure \"a very mild decline\". He said that despite the retreat, the index remained at a relatively high level and that he expected \"a modest economic upswing\" to continue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Germany's economy grew 1.6% last year after shrinking in 2003. However, the economy contracted by 0.2% during the last three months of 2004, mainly due to the reluctance of consumers to spend. Latest indications are that growth is still proving elusive and Ifo president Hans-Werner Sinn said any improvement in German domestic demand was sluggish. Exports had kept things going during the first half of 2004, but demand for exports was then hit as the value of the euro hit record levels making German products less competitive overseas. On top of that, the unemployment rate has been stuck at close to 10% and manufacturing firms, including DaimlerChrysler, Siemens and Volkswagen, have been negotiating with unions over cost cutting measures. Analysts said that the Ifo figures and Germany's continuing problems may delay an interest rate rise by the European Central Bank.

      "The number of people out of work rose 32,000 to 1.41 million in the last three months of 2004, even as 90,000 more people were in employment. Average earnings rose by 4.3% in the year to December up from November's 4.2%, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) added. Meanwhile, the benefit claimant total fell 11,000 to 813,200 last month. Throughout 2004, the number of people in work increased by 296,000 to 28.52 million - the highest figure since records began in 1971.\n",
      "\n",
      "The apparent discrepancy between rising unemployment and record numbers in work can be explained by an increase in the working population and a fall in those who are economically inactive. While the UK's jobless rate rose to 4.7% from 4.6% in the previous quarter, the rate still remains one of the lowest in the world, compared with 12.1% in Germany, 10.4% in Spain and 9.7% in France. But, despite more people being in work, the manufacturing sector continued to suffer, with 104,000 workers axed during the last quarter of 2004 - pushing employment in the sector to a record low of 3.24 million by the end of last year. The figures prompted some analysts to forecast that the Bank of England will almost certainly raise rates this year. Marc Ostwald, a strategist at Monument Securities told Reuters that while no immediate market impact could be expected, \"it is enough to underline that they (the BoE) will be more hawkish on rates\".\n",

      "\n",
      "Spacey, 45, wrote, directed and starred in the film, inspired by the life of 1950s croooner Bobby Darin. \"This is my tribute to someone I think was a remarkable talent,\" said Spacey, who, as Darin, sings all 18 songs on the film soundtrack. Bosworth, 21, plays Darin's wife - real life Hollywood actress Sandra Dee. \"I knew absolutely nothing about Bobby Darin before this film, but now I'm a huge fan,\" said Bosworth, who attended the premiere with British boyfriend Orlando Bloom.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is darkness and tragedy in the story, and it was a dream for me to land this part.\" Actress Sandra Dee continues to live in Los Angeles as a virtual recluse, but has given her approval to the biopic.\n",

      "\"She called me last week and said she loved it,\" said Spacey, who was joined at the premiere by members of the boy band Westlife. Spacey, a double Oscar-winner, has long been fascinated by the story of singer Bobby Darin. The voice behind Mack the Knife, Dream Lover and Beyond the Sea, fought childhood illness to become one the biggest stars of the 1950s, but died aged 37 from the heart condition that had troubled him all his life. \"Bobby Darin was one of the greatest entertainers the world has ever known, and yet, because he died young, he's been kind of forgotten,\" said Spacey at the premiere. \"Making this film was the most fun I've ever had in my entire life.\" The movie also stars British actors Bob Hoskins and Brenda Blethyn, as Darin's mother.\n",

      "\n",
      "The US Justice Department is to try to overturn a court ruling that threw out its claim for $280bn (£149bn) in damages from tobacco firms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier this month, a three-judge appeal court panel rejected the claim - filed in 1999 by the administration of Bill Clinton - in a 2-1 decision. Government lawyers said they would ask the full US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to hear the case. The court room battle is seen as key in government attempts to fight smoking. \"It's pretty clear that they've suffered a severe setback,\" said Anthony Sebok, a professor at Brooklyn Law School, adding that the appeal was what the government \"would be expected to ask for\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Prosecutors had argued that tobacco firms lied about the dangers of smoking, ignored research that highlighted problems, looked to increase addiction by manipulating nicotine levels and targeted the young with their adverts. Among the firms accused were Altria Group, RJ Reynolds Tobacco, Lorillard Tobacco, Liggett Group and Brown and Williamson. Prosecutors went after the companies using legislation put in place to fight organised crime, and accused the firms of conspiring and running \"Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations\". The tobacco companies denied the charges, saying that they never illegally conspired to promote smoking and fool the public. They also said that they have met many of the government's demands laid out in a landmark $206bn settlement hammered out in 1998 with 46 states. A three-judge panel agreed with the companies, finding that the case could not be brought under federal anti-racketeering laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "Central to the government's case was a meeting in the Plaza Hotel, New York, on 15 December, 1953. Prosecutors contend that executives from the major tobacco firms met and agreed to present a unified strategy denying the harmful effects of smoking. Despite denying for decades that smoking could be linked to illness, the companies have modified their stances in recent years. Altria's Philip Morris now accepts that nicotine is harmful, and the company's main lawyer William Ohlemeyer told the BBC last year that earlier statements may have been wrong but they were not dishonest. Government lawyers have until 21 March to file their appeal.\n",

      "\n",
      "The family of an Iraqi civilian allegedly killed by UK troops have won a challenge against the government's refusal to order a full inquiry.\n",
      "\n",
      "The High Court ruled on Tuesday that Baha Mousa's death in British custody in Iraq fell within the European Convention on Human Rights. And the judges paved the way for an independent inquiry by saying previous investigations were inadequate. But judicial reviews into five other deaths in southern Iraq were ruled out. Their families will be appealing against the judgement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The families' solicitor Phil Shiner described it as \"a historic day for human rights and the rule of law in the UK\". Father-of-two Mr Mousa, 28, a hotel receptionist, was arrested with eight men seized at a hotel in Basra in September 2003. He was allegedly beaten to death while in the custody of the Queen's Lancashire Regiment. The Iraqi families' lawyer argued that failing to adequately investigate the death breached the European Convention on Human Rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ministry of Defence lawyers argued the UK-controlled area of southern Iraq was outside European jurisdiction. But Lord Justice Rix and Mr Justice Forbes ruled that UK jurisdiction could extend to a UK-run prison, but did not apply \"to the total territory of another state\". They said as Mr Mousa was in custody when he died, his case came within the UK's jurisdiction. The other five Iraqis did not die in custody, so their cases had to fail, they said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it was difficult to say that the investigation which had already occurred \"has been timely, open or effective\", the judges said. After the ruling Carla Ferstman, legal director of the human rights organisation Redress, said: \"It is not enough for the military to investigate behind closed doors. \"There must be an effective public investigation by an independent official body. Only such an investigation could reveal what really happened and who might be responsible.\" Other allegations involving British soldiers included the shooting of an Iraqi police commissioner and the shooting of four Iraqi civilians in May 2003. Both sides were granted permission to appeal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prime Minister Tony Blair's official spokesman said: \"Obviously we will need to study this detailed judgment. I would point out, however, that a separate criminal case is currently being considered by the army prosecuting authority. \"I can't say anything further for obvious reasons. The MoD are considering whether to appeal.\" But former British Commander Colonel Bob Stewart said : \"Anyone at the top [of the military] will be saddened by the verdict that has taken place but will say: 'If there's a case to answer, let's have it out. Because we don't want people thinking that British soldiers beat up civilians and get away with it',\" he said. \"The Ministry of Defence does everything in its power to try to prove we act ethically and properly under the rules of war.\"\n",

The court in Washington found the case - filed by the Clinton administration in 1999 - could not be brought under federal anti-racketeering laws. Anti-smoking groups urge the government to fight on, but the Justice Department has not said if it will appeal.

      "Prosecutors wanted the cigarette firms to \"disgorge\" $280bn in profits accumulated over the past 50 years and impose tougher rules on marketing their products. They brought the case under racketeering laws, which were passed to deny mafia gangs the profits of their crimes. But the tobacco companies denied that they illegally conspired to promote smoking and defraud the public. They also said they had already met many of the government's demands in a landmark $206bn settlement reached with 46 states in 1998. The three-judge panel in the District of Columbia's Court of Appeals ruled on Friday that the US government could not sue the firms under the anti-racketeering laws. Judge David Sentelle, in his ruling, said such laws were aimed at putting an end to illegal conduct going forward. \"We hold that the language of (the law) and the comprehensive remedial scheme of (the law) preclude disgorgement as a possible remedy in this case,\" he wrote. The Justice Department refused to say if it would appeal. \"All we're saying today is that we have received the ruling and are reviewing it,\" a spokeswoman said on Friday. But William Corr of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids urged the government to continue pressing its case. \"Today's ruling should not be an excuse for this administration to seek a weak settlement that lets the tobacco industry off the hook,\" he said.\n",

      "\n",
      "Authorities in Philadelphia said they found insufficient evidence to support the woman's allegations regarding an alleged incident in January 2004. The woman reported the allegations to Canadian authorities last month. Cosby's lawyer, Walter M Phillips Jr, said the comedian was pleased with the decision. \"He looks forward to moving on with his life,\" he said. District Attorney Bruce L Castor Jr, who was in charge of the case, said that detectives could find no instance \"where anyone complained to law enforcement of conduct which would constitute a criminal offence.\n",

      "He also said that the fact the woman waited a year before coming forward, and she had had further contact with Cosby during that time, were also factors in his decision. The unidentified woman's lawyer, Dolores M Troiani, said her client was likely to sue the comedian. \"I think that's the only avenue open to her. She felt, as we did, that it's a very strong case and she was telling the truth.\" She also said that the woman supplied further evidence to prosecutors that she believed strengthened her allegations. Cosby emerged as one of the first black comics to have mainstream success in the US. He was a successful stand-up before hosting the children's show Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids, and starring in The Cosby Show, one of the biggest sitcoms of the 1980s.\n",

      "A senior barrister who has resigned in protest over the government's anti-terror laws says the current system is giving Britain a bad name.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ian MacDonald QC quit when the government failed to recognise a House of Lords ruling that detaining terror suspects indefinitely is unlawful. He was part of a 19-strong panel who have special security clearance to act for suspected terrorists. Five more barristers are now reported to be threatening to resign.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr MacDonald told BBC News: \"The reason why I am resigning is because I fundamentally disagree with locking people up without any trial for an indefinite period on reasonable suspicion. \"The current legal system is certainly having a very adverse effect on the Muslim community in Britain and the whole Asian community. \"I think it is giving Britain a bad name internationally\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act introduced by the government in 2001 in response to the 11 September attacks, foreign nationals suspected of involvement in terrorism who cannot be deported can be held indefinitely without trial. But Mr MacDonald believes that detainees currently being held should be entitled to a trial by jury. \"My own view is we need to have a full return to trial by jury, a proper criminal trial with proper accusations. \"As far as I'm concerned, the government have to start all over again and rethink their whole strategy for dealing with this.\" he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Attorney General Lord Goldsmith will receive a letter of resignation from Mr MacDonald on Monday. According to the Independent, his resignation is expected to be followed by those of five other barristers - Nicholas Blake QC, Andrew Nicol QC, Manjit Singh Gill QC, Rick Scannell and Tom de la Mare. They are all believed to be carefully considering their positions on the panel of Special Advocates who represent detainees before the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) - a secure court without a jury, which tries terror suspects. Mr MacDonald said he had \"no idea\" whether further resignations would follow. But Barry Hugill, a spokesman for the campaign group Liberty, told Radio 4's Today programme that more lawyers may go. \"I can assure that there is a distinct possibilty that more lawyers may be resigning,\" he said. \"They are now in a situation where everything they have been trained to believe in, the right to trial by jury, has been abandoned and that is what gives some of them sleepless nights.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Helena Kennedy, a Labour peer and a human rights lawyer, said the Special Advocates' main concern was that once they had seen any special intelligence they were not allowed to speak to the detainees. \"When this whole procedure was being considered immediately after 11 September there was a great deal of argument particularly in the House of Lords about whether there really was a process that could be considered a judicial review,\" she said. \"Without that you are having detention with no habeus corpus and really a blot, as Ian McDonald has said, on our legal landscape, something really quite shocking with regard to the rule of the law.\"\n",
